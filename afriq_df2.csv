There was no etiology found after a diligent search. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this pregnancy?
###Options:
A.  With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient
B.  Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation
C.  Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.
D.  Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation

###Answer:",C,"A history of abruption that is unexplained confers an increased risk of abruption with subsequent pregnancies. Antenatal testing does not predict acute events such as abruption. Rather, fetal testing such as biophysical profile is designed to identify chronic uteroplacental insufficiency such as caused by chronic hypertension, renal insufficiency, or maternal lupus. Ultrasound has poor ability to identify retroplacental clots or abruption. Induction at or slightly before the time of abruption with the fetal loss, if at term, is a reasonable approach to avoid repeat abruption.","With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient",Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation,Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.,Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation,,C,"C. Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation. Rationale: Women with a history of abruptio placentae have an increased risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Given the fetal death at 38 weeks' gestation in the previous pregnancy, it is recommended to consider induction of labor at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation to reduce the risk of a similar outcome in the current pregnancy. The other options are incorrect:  A: The risk of abruption in this pregnancy is higher than in other pregnancies, even if no etiology was found.
 B: Antenatal testing is not routinely recommended for women with a history of abruption.
 D: Weekly ultrasound examinations are not indicated for screening for retroplacental hemorrhage in this case.",True,model2

He has had two bloody stools and vomiting. The infant is irritable with a temperature of 38.5 C. The abdomen seems tender, and the child continues crying. What is the best initial diagnostic test?
###Options:
A.  Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites
B.  Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view
C.  Abdominal ultrasound
D.  Plain radiograph of the abdomen
E.  CT scan

###Answer:",C,"The patient, being between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, most likely has ileocolic intussusception.

The history is consistent with this diagnosis, and occasionally a sausage-shaped mass can be palpated in the right upper quadrant. Plain radiographs may be helpful to exclude perforation or when ultrasound is not immediately available and can show characteristic bowel obstruction. The ""target sign,"" consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on the right kidney, represents peritoneal fat surrounding and within the intussusception. The ""crescent sign"" is a soft tissue density representing the intussusceptum projecting into the gas of the large bowel, obscured liver margin, or lack of air in the cecum.

Air, saline, or barium enema can reduce the intussusception or make the diagnosis but are not usually the first study ordered because there is a risk of bowel rupture. Prior to the enema, the patient must be cleared for surgery. There is no preparation required for an abdominal ultrasound.

Bowel perforation must be excluded prior to radiologic intervention. Air has the least incidence of perforation.","Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites",Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view,Abdominal ultrasound,Plain radiograph of the abdomen,CT scan,C,"C. Abdominal ultrasound Rationale: The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of intussusception, a condition where one part of the intestine telescopes into another. Abdominal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality for diagnosing intussusception. It can demonstrate the characteristic ""target sign"" or ""doughnut sign,"" which represents the telescoped bowel. Other options may be considered in specific cases, but they are not the best initial diagnostic test for suspected intussusception.",True,model2

A.  Folate supplementation
B.  Hydroxyurea
C.  Multivitamins
D.  Pneumococcal vaccine
E.  Prophylactic penicillin

###Answer:",B,"- Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used in the management of sickle cell disease. It works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which inhibits the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, thus reducing the frequency of sickle cell crises, including pain crises.- Folate supplementation (option a) can be beneficial for individuals with sickle cell disease to help with red blood cell production, but it is not primarily used to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises.- Multivitamins (option c) may be recommended as part of the overall management of sickle cell disease to ensure adequate nutrition, but they are not specifically targeted at reducing sickle cell crises.- Pneumococcal vaccine (option d) and prophylactic penicillin (option e) are important for preventing infections in individuals with sickle cell disease, particularly as they are at increased risk of infections due to functional asplenia.

However, as the obstruction persists, symptoms may escalate, manifesting as increased pain and the appearance of a purulent, foul-smelling, bloody discharge. When unilateral nasal discharge is present alongside obstruction, it suggests the possibility of a nasal foreign body and warrants examination. While polyps could potentially cause unilateral nasal obstruction, they are uncommon in children of 18 months and might indicate a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, though not impossible, is rare in black children. Frontal sinusitis typically doesn't result in unilateral symptoms, and sinusitis is uncommon in an 18-month-old child due to incomplete sinus development at that age.

C.  Conization of the cervix
D.  Hysterectomy
E.  Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months

###Answer:",C,"One indication for a cone biopsy is when a cervical biopsy or colposcopic impression does not adequately explain the severity of the Pap smear result. In approximately 10% of cases where cervical biopsies are directed by colposcopy, there can be a significant discordance between the Pap smear and biopsy results. For instance, the biopsy may appear normal while the Pap smear indicates severely abnormal cells. Conization of the cervix becomes necessary to rule out lesions higher in the endocervical canal. Simply repeating the Pap smear is not advisable as it may delay treatment of a potentially serious issue. Once cervical dysplasia is confirmed, cryotherapy and laser ablation are viable treatment options.

###Answer:",A,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitisThe presence of periorbital and facial oedema with normal blood pressure in this toddler indicates that he has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individuals health and quality of life:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid  an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/µL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult.

A.  Sitz baths
B.  high-fiber diet.
C.  opical nitroglycerin ointment and surgery follow-up.
D.  Laxatives, and topical nitroglycerin ointment.
E.  Pain control, laxatives, Sitz baths, and GI referral.

###Answer:",E,"The patient presents with rectal pain on every bowel movement. There is no mention of erythema, fevers, or purulent discharge to suggest an anal fistula. Furthermore, anal fistulas are more likely to occur in those with Crohn's disease.

An anal fissure is the answer of choice as this patient's exam cannot be fully completed due to pain. The presentation is acute, and patients likely report having fears of bowel movements due to the nature of the pain.

The pain of an anal fissure can be intense and burning, most commonly during defecation, and can last for an extended time after. Onset can be abrupt or chronic, and usually, constipation is associated with it unless an underlying pathology exists.

The first-line therapy for anal fissures is conservative management using sitz baths, laxatives, and oral pain control.

D.  Raised plasma lactate
E.  Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. A large pericardial effusion reduces the amplitude of the ECG as the myocardial tissue is further away from the recording electrodes. The heart may rotate within the pericardial sac so that there is a motion artefact on the ECG (electrical alternans). There may be an increased fall in blood pressure on inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) as the increased venous return to the right heart causes the septum to bulge into the left ventricle, impeding cardiac output. Concave ST elevation in a pattern that does not correspond to coronary ischaemia is typical of pericarditis, which may be complicated by pericardial tamponade.

###Answer:",C,"The vignette represents a classical presentation of acute pancreatitis with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back and is associated with nausea and vomiting which is relieved by bending forward. Elevation in serum lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pathophysiology of pancreatitis involves both the localized destruction in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response. The inciting event is the premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the acinar cell.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is defined by the Revised Atlanta Classification and requires at least 2 of 3 criteria be met: 1) a lipase or amylase level that is three times the upper limit of normal 2) abdominal pain that is consistent with pancreatitis 3) abdominal imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. A pseudocyst, the most likely complication, is a walled-off fluid collection seen after 4 weeks of an acute episode.

Management for acute pancreatitis includes early aggressive fluid resuscitation and nutrition. Mortality is 1% to 2%. Most of thee pseudocysts resolve with observation alone with periodic follow-up using CT or MRI. Drainage is only recommended in symptomatic, infected or rapidly enlarging pseudocysts.

Her physical examination reveals a hard, immobile 5 x 2 cm mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. On ultrasound, the mass is hypoechoic with irregular borders and septations. An excisional biopsy is performed and the sample is ER+. The patient undergoes bilateral radical mastectomies. Which of the following is the most appropriate adjuvant therapy?
###Options:
A.  Finasteride
B.  Fadrozole
C.  Clomiphene citrate
D.  Letrozole
E.  progesterone

###Answer:",D,"Adjuvant chemotherapy prevents breast cancer recurrence and is indicated in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptive breast cancer with a mass of >1 cm at diagnosis or evidence of metastasis. An increase in cells that express ER is present in a majority of breast cancers. Therefore, a variety of pharmacologic agents have been developed to decrease estrogen production and activity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (like tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (like anastrozole) are approved for use in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer because of their mechanisms related to decreasing estrogen levels.

Letrozole and anastrozole are both third-generation aromatase inhibitors that are the most specific toward targeting aromatase and are the most appropriate drugs of choice when choosing aromatase Inhibitors.

Fadrozole is a second-generation aromatase inhibitor that exhibited less specificity for the enzyme aromatase and has an increase of adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rashes, etc. in comparison to third-generation aromatase inhibitors.

Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?
###Options:
A.  Kidney
B.  Pancreas
C.  Bone marrow
D.  Lungs
E.  heart

###Answer:",A,"This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered. Once the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended",Kidney,Pancreas,Bone marrow,Lungs,heart,A,"A. Kidney Rationale:

B.  Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters
C.  Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters
D.  Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a soft tissue infection, likely cellulitis or abscess formation, around the puncture wound. The presence of fever with shaking chills, lethargy, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot are indicative of systemic involvement, suggesting a more severe infection.Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease, they are at an increased risk of infections due to impaired immune function and compromised blood flow to tissues, which can predispose them to complications such as osteomyelitis or septicemia.The characteristic warm, swollen, and extremely tender area around the wound suggests a bacterial infection, and the likely causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that commonly causes skin and soft tissue infections. The presence of coagulase, an enzyme that enables the bacterium to form clots, helps in its identification.

She has recently given birth to a healthy baby boy and is enjoying being a mother. However, she is becoming more reliant on her partner for support as she always feels exhausted and often becomes depressed. The patient has a poor appetite and often does not finish her meals, despite this she has gained 5 kg in the last 2 weeks. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Postpartum depression
B.  Eating disorder
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Occult malignancy

###Answer:",D,"Hypothyroidism (D) is a common disease with a higher prevalence in females and is usually a primary disorder affecting the thyroid gland itself. Thyroid hormones control the metabolic rate in many tissues, underactivity produces symptoms which are often insidious. These include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. The main causes include iodine deficiency, autoimmune pathology such as Hashimotos thyroiditis and, in females who have recently given birth, postpartum thyroiditis. Hyperthryoidism (C) results in an excess of thyroid hormones which inappropriately increases metabolic rate with symptoms such as weight loss, increased sweating, restlessness and palpitations. A goitre can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Postpartum depression (A) is often accompanied by confusion and is characterized by low mood, anhedonia and anergia. Severely affected patients can have delusional thoughts about their newborn child, such as it being evil, and even progress to thoughts of harming the child or suicidal ideation. Eating disorders (B), such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa, often result in drastic changes in body weight resulting from psychological problems with self-image and include behaviours such as self-induced vomiting to avoid weight gain or binge eating.

His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F). Physicalexamination shows swelling of the parotid glands. Which of the following infectious agents is the most likely cause ofthese findings?
###Options:
A.  Epstein-Barr virus
B.  Hepatitis B virus
C.  Measles virus
D.  Mumps virus
E.  Rubella virus

###Answer:",D,"Mumps is a contagious viral infection caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. It commonly presents with swelling of the parotid glands (parotitis), leading to the characteristic swollen cheeks or jaw. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and pain with swallowing.Given the swelling of the parotid glands observed during the physical examination, along with the constellation of symptoms described, mumps virus is the most likely infectious agent responsible for these findings.Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Mumps virus.",Epstein-Barr virus,Hepatitis B virus,Measles virus,Mumps virus,Rubella virus,D,"D. Mumps virus Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, decreased appetite, and swollen parotid glands are classic signs of mumps. The other listed viruses do not typically cause parotitis. Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis, which can also present with swollen glands, but usually affects the lymph nodes rather than the parotid glands. Hepatitis B virus causes liver disease. Measles and rubella viruses cause rashes and other systemic symptoms, but not parotitis.",True,model2

He also has had loose, fatty, foul-smelling stoolsand a cough during the past 2 weeks. He is at the 30th percentile for height and 10th percentile for weight. Physicalexamination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show steatorrhea and a sweat chloride concentration of80 mmol/L. A chest x-ray shows hyperinflation. Sputum culture grows Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcusaureus. Secretion of which of the following substances is most likely to be decreased in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Bicarbonate
B.  Gastric acid
C.  Glucagon
D.  Insulin
E.  Intrinsic factor

###Answer:",A,"In cystic fibrosis, the CFTR dysfunction leads to impaired bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts, which results in thickening of pancreatic secretions, obstruction of the pancreatic ducts, and subsequent pancreatic insufficiency. This pancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to the clinical manifestation of steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools).Therefore, the substance most likely to be decreased in this patient is:(A) BicarbonateDecreased bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts contributes to the pathophysiology of steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis.",Bicarbonate,Gastric acid,Glucagon,Insulin,Intrinsic factor,A,"A. Bicarbonate Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the pancreas. The pancreas produces bicarbonate, which helps neutralize stomach acid and allows digestive enzymes to work properly. In cystic fibrosis, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic ducts, leading to a deficiency of bicarbonate and other pancreatic enzymes, resulting in malabsorption, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive.",True,model2

Despite his young age, he exhibits signs of chronic liver disease, with a blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, a heart rate of 126 beats/min, and a pale appearance. Despite normal findings on rectal examination, he continues to vomit blood in the emergency room, prompting the placement of an artificial airway and the initiation of fluid resuscitation.
###Options:
A.  Gastric ulcer
B.  Gastric antral vascular lesion
C.  Esophageal varices
D.  Duodenal ulcer
E.  MalloryWeiss tear

###Answer:",C,"The probable cause of this substantial upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is esophageal varices resulting from portal hypertension. While MalloryWeiss tears are frequently observed in young patients who experience retching and vomiting, the history and severity of bleeding in this case make it less likely. Although bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers could manifest similarly, they are uncommon in young individuals without additional health issues.",Gastric ulcer,Gastric antral vascular lesion,Esophageal varices,Duodenal ulcer,MalloryWeiss tear,C,"C. Esophageal varices Rationale: The patient's presentation is consistent with ruptured esophageal varices, which are a common complication of chronic liver disease. The combination of hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of chronic liver disease strongly suggests this diagnosis. The presence of esophageal varices is typically confirmed by emergency endoscopy.",True,model2
