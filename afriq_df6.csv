###Options:
A.  Handwashing with soap and water
B.  Using insect repellents
C.  Sleeping under mosquito nets
D.  Wearing respiratory masks in crowded places
E.  Regular exercise

###Answer:",D,"Wearing respiratory masks in crowded places helps prevent the inhalation of TB bacteria, especially in areas with high TB prevalence.",Handwashing with soap and water,Using insect repellents,Sleeping under mosquito nets,Wearing respiratory masks in crowded places,Regular exercise,D,"D.  Wearing respiratory masks in crowded places

Rationale: The recommended method for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) is wearing respiratory masks in crowded places. TB is an airborne disease, and the primary mode of transmission is through the inhalation of droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Wearing respiratory masks, especially in crowded places, can help reduce the transmission of TB by preventing the inhalation of these droplet nuclei. Handwashing with soap and water (Option A) is important for preventing the transmission of many infectious diseases, but it is not specifically effective against TB. Insect repellents (Option B) and sleeping under mosquito nets (Option C) are measures used to prevent mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, not TB. Regular exercise (Option E) is important for overall health but is not a method for preventing TB transmission.",True,model6

There was no etiology found after a diligent search. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this pregnancy?
###Options:
A.  With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient
B.  Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation
C.  Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.
D.  Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation

###Answer:",C,"A history of abruption that is unexplained confers an increased risk of abruption with subsequent pregnancies. Antenatal testing does not predict acute events such as abruption. Rather, fetal testing such as biophysical profile is designed to identify chronic uteroplacental insufficiency such as caused by chronic hypertension, renal insufficiency, or maternal lupus. Ultrasound has poor ability to identify retroplacental clots or abruption. Induction at or slightly before the time of abruption with the fetal loss, if at term, is a reasonable approach to avoid repeat abruption.","With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient",Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation,Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.,Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation,,B,"B

Rationale: 
Abruptio placentae is a serious complication of pregnancy. In the absence of an identifiable etiology, the risk of recurrence is increased. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends antenatal testing with biophysical profile starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation in women with a history of abruptio placentae. This is to identify any potential fetal compromise and to guide timing of delivery. Induction of labor at 37 to 38 weeks gestation may be considered, but only after careful evaluation and discussion with the patient. There is no evidence to support weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage starting at 32 weeks gestation.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Hand hygiene
B.  Condom use
C.  Oral antibiotics
D.  Isolation procedures
E.  Wearing of gloves

###Answer:",B,"Condom use is an effective method of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, along with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is an important component of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies.",Hand hygiene,Condom use,Oral antibiotics,Isolation procedures,Wearing of gloves,B,"B

Rationale: Condom use is an effective method of preventing the transmission of HIV, as it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids between sexual partners. While hand hygiene, wearing of gloves, and isolation procedures are important infection control measures, they are not specifically targeted at preventing HIV transmission. Oral antibiotics are not a method of preventing HIV transmission.",True,model6

Rationale: Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect. The exact mechanism of this is unclear, but it may be related to the increased blood flow to the periphery and the resulting increased hydrostatic pressure. Calcium channel blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, and peripheral edema is a common side effect of these medications.",True,model6

He has had two bloody stools and vomiting. The infant is irritable with a temperature of 38.5 C. The abdomen seems tender, and the child continues crying. What is the best initial diagnostic test?
###Options:
A.  Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites
B.  Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view
C.  Abdominal ultrasound
D.  Plain radiograph of the abdomen
E.  CT scan

###Answer:",C,"The patient, being between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, most likely has ileocolic intussusception.

The history is consistent with this diagnosis, and occasionally a sausage-shaped mass can be palpated in the right upper quadrant. Plain radiographs may be helpful to exclude perforation or when ultrasound is not immediately available and can show characteristic bowel obstruction. The ""target sign,"" consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on the right kidney, represents peritoneal fat surrounding and within the intussusception. The ""crescent sign"" is a soft tissue density representing the intussusceptum projecting into the gas of the large bowel, obscured liver margin, or lack of air in the cecum.

Air, saline, or barium enema can reduce the intussusception or make the diagnosis but are not usually the first study ordered because there is a risk of bowel rupture. Prior to the enema, the patient must be cleared for surgery. There is no preparation required for an abdominal ultrasound.

Bowel perforation must be excluded prior to radiologic intervention. Air has the least incidence of perforation.","Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites",Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view,Abdominal ultrasound,Plain radiograph of the abdomen,CT scan,D,"D. Plain radiograph of the abdomen

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with an acute abdomen, specifically an intussusception. The best initial diagnostic test would be a plain radiograph of the abdomen to rule out free air in the abdomen, which would indicate a perforation. The radiograph can also show signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated bowel loops or a soft tissue mass. If the radiograph is negative, an air contrast enema (Option B) would be the next step to diagnose and potentially treat the intussusception. Options A and C are not the best initial diagnostic tests, as they are more specific to certain diagnoses and would not provide an immediate diagnosis. Option E is not indicated in this scenario.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Ventricular tachycardia
B.  Atrial fibrillation
C.  Bradycardia
D.  Ventricular fibrillation
E.  Cardiac arrest

Atrial fibrillation

Rationale: Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a type of arrhythmia characterized by an irregular and often rapid heart rate. It can increase the risk of strokes, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. AFib occurs when the upper chambers of the heart (atria) beat too quickly and irregularly, causing the heart to pump less efficiently. This can lead to blood clots forming in the heart, which can increase the risk of stroke and other complications.",True,model6

In an individual afflicted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and presenting with a CD4 cell count below 100 cells/mm3, what initial course of action is recommended?
###Options:
A.  Serum candida antigen
B.  Chest computed tomography (CT)
C.  Endoscopy
D.  Fluconazole
E.  Stool candida culture

###Answer:",D,"In individuals with AIDS presenting with a CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 alongside symptoms of odynophagia, esophageal candidiasis is identifiable in approximately 90% of cases. Given the notably elevated probability of Candida infection in AIDS patients, empirical therapy represents a viable approach for confirming diagnosis in such instances. It is imperative to note the absence of a serum candida antigen test. Should initial treatment fail to yield desired outcomes, subsequent consideration should be given to performing an endoscopic examination.",Serum candida antigen,Chest computed tomography (CT),Endoscopy,Fluconazole,Stool candida culture,D,"D. Fluconazole

Rationale: 
In individuals with AIDS, odynophagia is often caused by esophageal candidiasis. Since the CD4 cell count is below 100 cells/mm3, empiric treatment with fluconazole is recommended initially. This is because esophageal candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. Endoscopy may be required later if symptoms persist or if there are concerns about other diagnoses. Serum candida antigen and stool candida culture are not typically used for diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis. Chest CT may be useful if there are concerns about pulmonary involvement, but it is not the primary diagnostic or therapeutic approach for odynophagia in this scenario.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Splenomegaly
B.  Microcytic anemia
C.  Thrombocytopenia
D.  Pancytopenia
E.  Leukocytosis

Rationale: Sickle cell disease in African children often presents with leukocytosis, which is a common clinical feature. This is due to the body's response to chronic inflammation and infection. In contrast, splenomegaly is not typically seen in African children with sickle cell disease, as the spleen often becomes non-functional early in life due to repeated infarctions. Microcytic anemia is not a characteristic of sickle cell disease, and thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia are not typically associated with the disease.",False,model6

This is her 4th visit with such complaints due to her sickle cell disease. What medication can be used to reduce the number of sickle cell crisis?
###Options:
A.  Folate supplementation
B.  Hydroxyurea
C.  Multivitamins
D.  Pneumococcal vaccine
E.  Prophylactic penicillin

###Answer:",B,"- Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used in the management of sickle cell disease. It works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which inhibits the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, thus reducing the frequency of sickle cell crises, including pain crises.- Folate supplementation (option a) can be beneficial for individuals with sickle cell disease to help with red blood cell production, but it is not primarily used to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises.- Multivitamins (option c) may be recommended as part of the overall management of sickle cell disease to ensure adequate nutrition, but they are not specifically targeted at reducing sickle cell crises.- Pneumococcal vaccine (option d) and prophylactic penicillin (option e) are important for preventing infections in individuals with sickle cell disease, particularly as they are at increased risk of infections due to functional asplenia. However, they do not directly reduce the number of sickle cell crises.  Therefore, the most appropriate choice to reduce the number of sickle cell crises is hydroxyurea.",Folate supplementation,Hydroxyurea,Multivitamins,Pneumococcal vaccine,Prophylactic penicillin,B,"B

Rationale: Hydroxyurea is a medication that has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises, hospitalizations, and transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease. It increases the production of fetal hemoglobin, which can help to reduce the sickling of red blood cells. It is often used in patients with severe sickle cell disease, particularly those who have frequent crises or are at risk for complications such as stroke. Folate supplementation is important in patients with sickle cell disease, but it does not reduce the frequency of crises. Multivitamins are also important for overall health, but they do not have a specific role in reducing sickle cell crises. Pneumococcal vaccine is important for preventing infections, but it does not reduce the frequency of crises. Prophylactic penicillin is used to prevent infections, particularly in children with sickle cell disease, but it does not reduce the frequency of crises.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  MRCP
B.  Endoscopic Ultrasound
C.  Secretin Stimulation Test
D.  Lipase
E.  none of the above

###Answer:",C,"The Secretin Stimulation Test is the best diagnostic test for chronic pancreatitis because it has high sensitivity and specificity. This test involves injecting secretin, a hormone that stimulates the pancreas, and measuring the pancreatic secretions. In chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas does not respond properly to secretin, leading to abnormal secretions. This test can accurately diagnose chronic pancreatitis by detecting these abnormalities. MRCP and Endoscopic Ultrasound can also be used to visualize the pancreas, but they are not as specific for chronic pancreatitis. Lipase is an enzyme that can be elevated in pancreatitis, but it is not specific to chronic pancreatitis and can be elevated in other conditions as well.",MRCP,Endoscopic Ultrasound,Secretin Stimulation Test,Lipase,none of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is considered the most sensitive and specific test for chronic pancreatitis. It can detect early changes in the pancreatic parenchyma and ductal system, including calcifications, fibrosis, and ductal irregularities. EUS has a sensitivity of 80-90% and a specificity of 90-95% for chronic pancreatitis. It is also useful for evaluating pancreatic masses and guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy. MRCP is also a useful test, but it has a lower sensitivity and specificity compared to EUS.

###Answer:",B,Luteinizing hormone is responsible for triggering ovulation in menstrual cycle,Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH),Luteinizing hormone,Progesterone,Oestrogen,Testosterone,B,"B.  Luteinizing hormone

Rationale: 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) is the primary hormone responsible for triggering ovulation in females during the menstrual cycle. LH is released from the pituitary gland and stimulates the dominant follicle to release the ovum from the ovary. The surge in LH levels typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle and is often referred to as the LH surge. This surge in LH triggers ovulation, which usually occurs 24-48 hours after the peak LH levels.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"Infants who consume cow's milk are at the greatest risk of developing iron deficiency anemia, which can negatively impact growth and development. Research on iron therapy in populations at high risk has demonstrated its significant effect on development. Postmenopausal women typically do not face a high risk of anemia. However, elderly individuals, due to inadequate diet, may be at increased risk. To mitigate the incidence of iron deficiency anemia, breastfeeding supplemented with iron-fortified supplements starting at 4 to 6 months, as well as feeding infants iron-fortified formula, can be effective strategies.",An elderly widow living alone,A 10-month-old with a diet of cows milk,A postmenopausal woman,A 14-year-old with heavy periods,A breast-fed one-month-old infant,A,"A. An elderly widow living alone

Rationale: Iron deficiency anemia is more common in the elderly population, particularly those who live alone and have a poor diet. This is because iron absorption decreases with age, and the elderly may have a lower intake of iron-rich foods. Additionally, the elderly may have underlying chronic diseases that can lead to anemia, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic kidney disease. In this scenario, the elderly widow living alone is more susceptible to adverse effects associated with iron deficiency anemia due to her age, potential poor diet, and possible underlying chronic diseases.",False,model6

PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, typically caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The patient's symptoms, particularly the cervical motion tenderness, are consistent with this diagnosis. While ectopic pregnancy (Option B) may also cause pelvic pain, the patient's symptoms do not suggest an acute abdomen or peritoneal signs, which are more typical of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cyst (Option C) would not typically cause fever, vaginal discharge, or cervical motion tenderness. Uterine leiomyoma (Option D) is a benign tumor that would not cause these symptoms.

E.  Infant nurses less than every 6 hours at night

###Answer:",E,"Lactational amenorrhoea is an effective method of contraception. Individuals must breast feed exclusively, feeding every 4 hours in the day and 6 hours at night. When individuals have their first menstrual period, reach 6 months old and their infant feeds less often this method is no longer effective",Infant nurses more than every 6 hours at night,The infant is not supplemented with formula,3 months post natal,exclusive breastfeeding,Infant nurses less than every 6 hours at night,E,"E
Rationale: Lactational amenorrhea is useful as a method of contraception under the following conditions: 
1.  The mother is exclusively breastfeeding (i.e., the baby is not supplemented with formula or other foods).
2.  The baby is less than 6 months old.
3.  The mother is amenorrheic (has not resumed menstruating).

Breastfeeding inhibits the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn inhibits the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). As a result, ovulation does not occur, and the mother is less likely to become pregnant. This method is about 98% effective during the first 6 months postpartum, but its effectiveness decreases after that.",True,model6

Warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Vitamin K can reverse warfarin's effect by promoting the synthesis of these factors. However, this process takes several hours. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains these factors and can rapidly reverse warfarin's effect, but it requires large volumes and may cause volume overload. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are a concentrated source of these factors and can rapidly reverse warfarin's effect with a smaller volume. They are the preferred choice for urgent reversal of warfarin's effect, especially in patients with life-threatening bleeding, such as this patient with an intracranial hemorrhage.

The fimbriae are intraperitoneal. The tubal lumen becomes increasingly more complex as it approaches the ovary. In tubal reanastomoses, the greatest success is attained when isthmic-isthmic or isthmic-ampullary regions can be reapproximated.

Rationale: 
The patient is at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) because of his age, hypertension, and family history. The abdominal examination suggests an aneurysm because of the palpable aortic pulsation (estimated at 3 cm in width) and the presence of a midepigastric bruit. Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. It is a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive test that can accurately diagnose an AAA.

###Options:
A.  Foreign body
B.  Nasal polyps
C.  Frontal sinusitis
D.  Deviated septum
E.  Choanal atresia

###Answer:",A,"Young children often insert various small objects into their noses, including food or small toys. Initially, this may only cause local irritation. However, as the obstruction persists, symptoms may escalate, manifesting as increased pain and the appearance of a purulent, foul-smelling, bloody discharge. When unilateral nasal discharge is present alongside obstruction, it suggests the possibility of a nasal foreign body and warrants examination. While polyps could potentially cause unilateral nasal obstruction, they are uncommon in children of 18 months and might indicate a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, though not impossible, is rare in black children. Frontal sinusitis typically doesn't result in unilateral symptoms, and sinusitis is uncommon in an 18-month-old child due to incomplete sinus development at that age. Similarly, a deviated septum is not typically found in young children. Choanal atresia typically presents in the newborn period, characterized by episodes of respiratory distress at rest that improve with crying.",Foreign body,Nasal polyps,Frontal sinusitis,Deviated septum,Choanal atresia,A,"A

Rationale: The presence of unilateral nasal obstruction and foul-smelling discharge in an otherwise healthy 18-month-old child is highly suggestive of a nasal foreign body. This is especially common in children of this age group who are curious and often insert small objects into their nostrils. The foul-smelling discharge is likely due to the presence of a retained foreign body, which can cause a secondary infection. Nasal polyps (option B) are rare in children and usually occur in association with cystic fibrosis or allergic rhinitis. Frontal sinusitis (option C) is unlikely in an 18-month-old child, as the frontal sinuses do not develop until around 6 years of age. Deviated septum (option D) may cause nasal obstruction, but it is unlikely to cause a foul-smelling discharge. Choanal atresia (option E) is a congenital anomaly that typically presents in the neonatal period with bilateral nasal obstruction and is unlikely to present at 18 months of age.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"Bronchiolitis is most commonly cause by a viral infection, making Staph Aureus unlikely. RSV is the most common pathogen.",Adenovirus,Staph Aureus,Rhinovirus,Respiratory Syncytial Virus,Enterovirus,D,"D. Respiratory Syncytial Virus

Rationale: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing bronchiolitis, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. It is a highly contagious virus that affects the lower respiratory tract, particularly in young children. The symptoms of RSV infection can range from mild to severe and include cough, runny nose, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. In severe cases, RSV can cause bronchiolitis, which can lead to respiratory failure. The other options are not as common causes of bronchiolitis in children.",True,model6

D.  Head CT
E.  E Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

###Answer:",C,"Given the patient's symptoms of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and painless swelling of cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, along with the absence of liver and spleen enlargement, the presentation is consistent with a concern for lymphadenopathy, particularly in the context of the classic triad of symptoms seen in tuberculosis (TB). Chest radiography is the initial step in evaluating patients suspected of having TB",Bone marrow aspiration,Abdominal CT,Chest radiography,Head CT,E Erythrocyte sedimentation rate,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms and signs that are highly suggestive of lymphoma, specifically Hodgkin lymphoma. The initial evaluation should include a chest radiograph to evaluate for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is a common feature of Hodgkin lymphoma. The chest radiograph will also help to determine the extent of the disease and guide further evaluation and staging. The other options are not necessary at this point in the evaluation. Bone marrow aspiration may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it is not the initial test of choice. Abdominal CT may be necessary to evaluate for lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm, but it is not the initial test of choice.

###Options:
A.  The measurement should be marked on the growth chart with a cross
B.  Correction for prematurity should be made up to the age of 6 months at least
C.  It is normal for an infant's weight to cross centiles in the first year
D.  Final height usually approximates the father's height
E.  Once a child is 5 years old height does not usually deviate from the centile line

###Answer:",C,It is normal and common for babies' weight to cross centiles in the first year of life. Measurements should be recorded on the growth chart with a dot. Correction for prematurity should be made up to the age of 1 year at least and 2 years for those born before 32 weeks. A child's height usually tracks along one centile from the age of 2 years until puberty when crossing centile lines occurs. Final height is expected to fall midway between the parents' positions on the height centiles.,The measurement should be marked on the growth chart with a cross,Correction for prematurity should be made up to the age of 6 months at least,It is normal for an infant's weight to cross centiles in the first year,Final height usually approximates the father's height,Once a child is 5 years old height does not usually deviate from the centile line,C,"C

Rationale: It is normal for an infant's weight to cross centiles in the first year. This is because the infant is adjusting to the extrauterine environment and may lose some weight initially before regaining it. Additionally, breastfed babies may lose more weight than formula-fed babies, but this is not a cause for concern. The other options are incorrect. The measurement should be marked on the growth chart with a dot, not a cross (A). Correction for prematurity should be made up to the age of 2 years, not 6 months (B). Final height is usually midway between the parents' heights, not the father's height (D).

Rationale: The symptoms presented by the patient, such as fever, bleeding from gums, and pallor, are indicative of a blood disorder. The peripheral blood film showing pancytopenia suggests that there is a deficiency of all three types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The most important investigation in this case would be a bone marrow examination, as it would help to identify the underlying cause of the pancytopenia. A bone marrow examination can help to diagnose conditions such as aplastic anemia, leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, which can cause pancytopenia.",True,model6

E.  None of the above

###Answer:",C,"Normal hemoglobin is composed predominantly of HbA1  which is composed of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains. In beta thalassemia trait, there is decrease in production of beta chains of hemoglobin. But since the defect is minor, they will not have any clinical features and the peripheral smear may be normal. But there will be a compensatory increase in HbA2 which is composed of 2 alpha chains and 2 delta chains. Normally HbA2 constitutes about 1.5 to 3.5% of total hemoglobin. But in beta thalassemia trait, this increases to about 3.6 to 8%",HbF,HbA1c,HbA2,HbH,None of the above,C,"C

Rationale: In beta thalassemia trait, there is a defect in the production of beta globin chains. As a result, there is an increase in the production of alpha globin chains, which combine with delta globin chains to form HbA2. Therefore, HbA2 levels are elevated in beta thalassemia trait, typically above 3.5%. This is a diagnostic feature of beta thalassemia trait and helps to distinguish it from iron deficiency anemia, which can have similar clinical and hematological features. HbF is elevated in beta thalassemia major, not in beta thalassemia trait. HbA1c is a measure of glycated hemoglobin and is not relevant to thalassemia. HbH is a tetramer of beta globin chains and is not relevant to beta thalassemia.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Increased reticulocyte count
B.  Increased hemoglobin
C.  Increased ferritin
D.  Increased serum iron

Rationale: The earliest indicator of response to iron therapy in a patient with iron deficiency anemia is an increase in reticulocyte count, which typically occurs within 7-10 days of starting treatment. This is because iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis, and when iron becomes available, the bone marrow rapidly produces new red blood cells, leading to an increase in reticulocytes. The other options are not correct because: 
- Hemoglobin levels may take several weeks to increase (option B).
- Ferritin levels may actually decrease initially as iron is mobilized from storage sites to meet the demands of hemoglobin synthesis (option C).

###Answer:",C,"One indication for a cone biopsy is when a cervical biopsy or colposcopic impression does not adequately explain the severity of the Pap smear result. In approximately 10% of cases where cervical biopsies are directed by colposcopy, there can be a significant discordance between the Pap smear and biopsy results. For instance, the biopsy may appear normal while the Pap smear indicates severely abnormal cells. Conization of the cervix becomes necessary to rule out lesions higher in the endocervical canal. Simply repeating the Pap smear is not advisable as it may delay treatment of a potentially serious issue. Once cervical dysplasia is confirmed, cryotherapy and laser ablation are viable treatment options. However, these are destructive procedures, meaning no tissue is preserved for histological evaluation, and should not be performed until a definitive diagnosis is made.

###Answer:",A,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitisThe presence of periorbital and facial oedema with normal blood pressure in this toddler indicates that he has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individuals health and quality of life:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid  an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/ÂµL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult.

###Options:
A.  Vaccination
B.  Sanitation
C.  Antibiotics
D.  Condoms
E.  prophylaxis

###Answer:",B,"Hepatitis A is transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

Sanitation has had the greatest impact on hepatitis A.

Vaccination has had an impact on hepatitis A, but not as great as sanitation.

Antibiotics have had no impact on hepatitis A.",Vaccination,Sanitation,Antibiotics,Condoms,prophylaxis,B,"B

Rationale: 
Hepatitis A is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, which means it is often acquired through contaminated food and water. In Nigeria, where access to clean water and proper sanitation may be limited, the risk of hepatitis A transmission is higher. Improving sanitation, such as providing access to clean water and proper waste disposal, has likely had the greatest impact on reducing the incidence of hepatitis A in Nigeria. Vaccination (option A) can also be effective in preventing hepatitis A, but it is not the primary measure that has had the greatest impact in Nigeria. Antibiotics (option C) are not effective against viral infections like hepatitis A, and condoms (option D) are not relevant to the transmission of hepatitis A. Prophylaxis (option E) is a general term that refers to any measure taken to prevent disease, but it is not a specific measure that has had a significant impact on hepatitis A incidence in Nigeria.",True,model6

His mother who is a hausa fulani woman gave birth to the baby at home and had no antenatal care and says that none of her other children have any health problems. His vital signs are respiratory rate 82 breaths/min, heart rate 135 bpm, and blood pressure 95/55 mm Hg. The physical examination shows a flat face with a broad nose. A musculoskeletal examination reveals club feet and the absence of a sacrum. The child has no urine output. Five hours after birth, the child dies despite ventilation and oxygenation. Which of the following additional findings would be seen on autopsy?
###Options:
A.  Renal cyst
B.  Renal agenesis
C.  Holoprosencephaly
D.  Posterior urethral valve
E.  absent mitrial valve

###Answer:",B,"Bilateral renal agenesis is classically seen in patients with Potter syndrome.

The ultrasound will show oligohydramnios and ""lying down adrenal sign.""

Infants with bilateral renal agenesis often have many other congenital disabilities.

When a kidney is not seen on an ultrasound, a careful search for an ectopic kidney must always be performed.",Renal cyst,Renal agenesis,Holoprosencephaly,Posterior urethral valve,absent mitrial valve,B,"B

Rationale: The symptoms described in the newborn, such as respiratory distress, cyanosis, and absence of urine output, are indicative of a severe congenital anomaly. The physical examination findings of a flat face, broad nose, club feet, and absence of a sacrum suggest a diagnosis of VACTERL (Vertebral, Anal, Cardiac, Tracheo-Esophageal, Renal, and Limb) association or caudal regression syndrome. The absence of a sacrum is a characteristic feature of caudal regression syndrome, which is often associated with maternal diabetes. However, in this case, the mother is a Hausa Fulani woman, which makes maternal diabetes less likely. The most likely diagnosis is therefore VACTERL association, which can be associated with renal agenesis. Renal agenesis would also explain the absence of urine output in the newborn.",True,model6

A.  Metabolic rate will increase
B.  Rate of movement will decrease
C.  Formation of prostaglandin E2 will increase
D.  Rate of oxygen consumption will increase
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Sperm cell motility decreases as pH is reduced below 6.8. At a pH of 4.5, sperm cell motility is significantly reduced. However, the buffering effect of sodium bicarbonate in the prostatic fluid raises the pH somewhat, allowing the sperm cells to regain some mobility",Metabolic rate will increase,Rate of movement will decrease,Formation of prostaglandin E2 will increase,Rate of oxygen consumption will increase,None of the above,B,"B. Rate of movement will decrease

Rationale: The normal pH of the vagina is around 4.5. Sperm cells are sensitive to pH changes. If the pH of the vagina is lowered to 4.5, the rate of movement of sperm cells will decrease. This is because sperm cells are adapted to function optimally at a pH around 7.2, which is the pH of semen. Lowering the pH of the vagina will make it difficult for sperm cells to move and fertilize the egg.",True,model6

A.  Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity
B.  Family history, early pregnancy, and diabetes
C.  Hypertension, oral contraceptives, and nulliparity
D.  Multiple pregnancies, obesity, and family history
E.  Family history, obesity, and nulliparity

###Answer:",A,"Endometrial cancer has been linked to hypertension, diabetes, low fertility, obesity, and late menopause. Interestingly, family history is not considered a risk factor. However, the use of oral contraceptives has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer.","Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity","Family history, early pregnancy, and diabetes","Hypertension, oral contraceptives, and nulliparity","Multiple pregnancies, obesity, and family history","Family history, obesity, and nulliparity",E,"E. Family history, obesity, and nulliparity

Rationale: 
Endometrial cancer has been associated with several risk factors, including:

1. Family history: Women with a family history of endometrial cancer, particularly those with Lynch syndrome, have an increased risk of developing the disease.
2. Obesity: Obesity is a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer, as it leads to increased estrogen levels, which can stimulate the growth of endometrial cells.
3. Nulliparity: Women who have never been pregnant have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer, possibly due to the lack of progesterone's protective effect on the endometrium.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Hypertension and diabetes are not specific risk factors for endometrial cancer, although they may be associated with obesity, which is a risk factor.
B. Early pregnancy is not a risk factor for endometrial cancer; in fact, it may have a protective effect.

Sickle cell-related intrahepatic cholestasis

Rationale: The patient has a history of sickle cell disease and has undergone cholecystectomy, ruling out gallstones as the cause of his symptoms. The presence of fever, impaired liver function, and hyperbilirubinemia suggests an acute hepatic process. Sickle cell-related intrahepatic cholestasis is a rare but known complication of sickle cell disease, characterized by episodes of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and impaired liver function.

In addition to standard 3236 week testing (chlamydia and gonorrhea cultures, repeat hematocrit, and Group B streptococcal screening), a nitrazine blue test is performed; results are positive. What conclusions may be drawn from this test?
###Options:
A.  This patient has candidiasis
B.  This patient has placenta previa
C.  This patient has normal vaginal secretions
D.  This patient is in premature labor
E.  This patient may have premature rupture of membranes or bacterial vaginosis

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. This patients presentation is consistent with both premature rupture of membranes and BV, given only the positive nitrazine paper test. Nitrazine tests nonspecifically for alkaline vaginal fluid, which may be amniotic fluid or the alkaline vaginal secretions associated with BV. At this point, no definite conclusion may be drawn. Further tests would include a wet mount in which case clue cells, or epithelial cells studded with bacteria, would be indicative of BV and evidence of ferning would suggest premature rupture of membranes. Although BV is normally associated with a foul odor, it is also notable for a lack of vaginal irritation, unlike other vaginoses.",This patient has candidiasis,This patient has placenta previa,This patient has normal vaginal secretions,This patient is in premature labor,This patient may have premature rupture of membranes or bacterial vaginosis,E,"E

Rationale: The nitrazine blue test is used to detect the presence of amniotic fluid in the vagina. It is based on the principle that amniotic fluid has a higher pH than normal vaginal secretions. When nitrazine blue is added to amniotic fluid, it turns blue, whereas it remains yellow or greenish in the presence of normal vaginal secretions. In this case, the test is positive, indicating that the fluid in the vaginal canal may be amniotic fluid (premature rupture of membranes) or it could be related to bacterial vaginosis, which also has a higher pH than normal vaginal secretions.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Contact precautions
B.  Vaccination
C.  Antiviral medication
D.  Respiratory protection
E.  Rodent control

###Answer:",E,"Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus, which is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with urine or feces of infected multimammate rats (Mastomys species). These rats are the natural reservoir of the virus. Preventing contact between humans and infected rodents is crucial to reduce the risk of transmission.",Contact precautions,Vaccination,Antiviral medication,Respiratory protection,Rodent control,E,"E. Rodent control

Rationale: Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in parts of West Africa. The most effective way to prevent the transmission of Lassa fever is by controlling the rodent population, specifically the multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis), which is the natural reservoir of the virus. This can be achieved through proper sanitation, storage of food, and elimination of hiding places for rodents. While contact precautions, vaccination, antiviral medication, and respiratory protection may be useful in preventing transmission in healthcare settings, rodent control is the most effective way to prevent transmission in the community.",True,model6

She complains of a headache, vomiting and malaise for the last week and is just beginning to develop a dry cough. Examination reveals a low grade fever and 'target lesions' developing on her body. What is the most likely causative pathogen for this presentation?
###Options:
A.  Haemophilus influenzae
B.  Legionella pneumophilia
C.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae
D.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis
E.  Streptococcus pneumoniae

###Answer:",C,The correct answer is mycoplasma pneumoniae. Living in small quarters such as barracks makes the spread of mycoplasma pneumoniae very easy. She also has extra pulmonary symptoms of malaise and vomiting leading into a dry cough. Erythema multiforme is caused mainly by herpes simplex virus but one of the next major infective causes is mycoplasma pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes a much more typical clinical picture of pneumonia with a wet cough producing rusty sputum. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause cough and fatigue but would also be more likely to have weight loss and night sweats. Erythema multiforme is also not seen with mycobacterium tuberculosis. Whilst haemophilus influenzae can cause pneumonia it is more common in children rather than adults. Legionella pneumophilia can cause a dry cough which later becomes productive with some extra pulmonary symptoms but is more common with a high fever and without any skin changes.,Haemophilus influenzae,Legionella pneumophilia,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,C,"C. Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including headache, vomiting, and malaise, are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of a low-grade fever and a dry cough also support this diagnosis. The ""target lesions"" on the patient's body are likely erythema multiforme, which is a known complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, and it often affects young adults, particularly those living in close quarters, such as in barracks.",True,model6

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in non-pregnant women are typically caused by E. coli, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a first-line agent for treating uncomplicated UTIs due to its high efficacy, low cost, and narrow spectrum of activity. It is effective against the most common causative organisms and has a low risk of selecting for resistant bacteria. Ceftriaxone (A) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may be used for more severe or complicated UTIs, but it is not the first choice for uncomplicated UTIs. Amoxicillin (B) is not effective against many of the organisms that cause UTIs. Metronidazole (C) is primarily used to treat anaerobic infections and is not effective against the aerobic organisms that cause UTIs.

B.  high-fiber diet.
C.  opical nitroglycerin ointment and surgery follow-up.
D.  Laxatives, and topical nitroglycerin ointment.
E.  Pain control, laxatives, Sitz baths, and GI referral.

###Answer:",E,"The patient presents with rectal pain on every bowel movement. There is no mention of erythema, fevers, or purulent discharge to suggest an anal fistula. Furthermore, anal fistulas are more likely to occur in those with Crohn's disease.

An anal fissure is the answer of choice as this patient's exam cannot be fully completed due to pain. The presentation is acute, and patients likely report having fears of bowel movements due to the nature of the pain.

The pain of an anal fissure can be intense and burning, most commonly during defecation, and can last for an extended time after. Onset can be abrupt or chronic, and usually, constipation is associated with it unless an underlying pathology exists.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of anal fissure, which is a tear in the lining of the anus. The symptoms are consistent with an anal fissure, including severe pain during bowel movements, bleeding, and fear of having a bowel movement leading to constipation. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis does not seem to be contributing to his current symptoms. The most appropriate therapy would be to treat the pain with pain control, laxatives to help soften the stool, Sitz baths to help with relaxation of the anal sphincter, and a GI referral to rule out any other conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms. Topical nitroglycerin ointment may be used to help relax the anal sphincter, but it is not the primary therapy.

###Answer:",A,"Metolazone can cause hyperuricemia. Serum uric acid levels should be monitored, especially in patients with a history of hyperuricemia.

Blood pressure, electrolytes, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine should be monitored in patients taking metolazone.

While thiazide diuretics often are used as first-line therapy for hypertension, diuretic resistance occurs, failing to reduce extracellular fluid volume. Combination therapy of furosemide and metolazone has proved to be more efficacious.

The patient's lipid profile, heart rate, and creatine kinase do not require monitoring while taking metolazone.",Uric acid,Lipid profile,Ejection fraction,Creatine kinase,serum potassium level,E,"E

Rationale: Metolazone is a diuretic that can cause potassium depletion. The patient is already taking spironolactone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic.

Rationale: Fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum, is a common childhood illness caused by the parvovirus B19. It is characterized by a distinctive ""slapped cheek"" rash, which is a bright red rash on the cheeks, accompanied by a low-grade fever, headache, and mild cold-like symptoms. The rash may spread to the arms, legs, and trunk, but it usually resolves on its own within a week or two.

Rationale: Once a fetus at risk is identified in a prolonged pregnancy, the best course of action is to proceed with delivery, regardless of the status of the cervix. This is because the risk of stillbirth and perinatal mortality increases with each passing day beyond 42 weeks of gestation. Therefore, prompt delivery is necessary to prevent any potential harm to the fetus.",False,model6

congenital megacolon is

###Options:
A.  Delayed evacuation of barium
B.  Air fluid levels
C.  Presence of a transition zone
D.  Dilated bowel loops

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is:

C. Presence of a transition zone.

In Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, a transition zone is typically observed on contrast studies such as barium enema or contrast enema. This transition zone represents the area between the aganglionic (affected) segment of the colon and the normal, ganglion cell-containing portion.

In contrast, congenital megacolon, also known as colonic dilation or congenital colonic dilatation, typically presents with generalized dilatation of the colon without a distinct transition zone. Therefore, the presence of a transition zone helps to distinguish Hirschsprung's disease from congenital megacolon on imaging studies.





",Delayed evacuation of barium,Air fluid levels,Presence of a transition zone,Dilated bowel loops,,C,"C. Presence of a transition zone

Rationale: Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal part of the colon, leading to a functional obstruction. The transition zone is the area where the normal colon meets the aganglionic segment, and it is typically narrowed and constricted. This zone is not seen in congenital megacolon. Therefore, the presence of a transition zone on an X-ray is a distinguishing feature of Hirschsprung's disease.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Fluconazole
B.  Amphotericin B
C.  Itraconazole
D.  Posaconazole
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Amphotericin B is the best choice since nephrotoxicity is commonly associated with this medication.

Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return

Rationale: Sinus venosus atrial septal defects are often associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), which is a congenital anomaly where one or more pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or a systemic vein instead of the left atrium. This is because the sinus venosus atrial septal defect forms when the sinus venosus fails to incorporate into the right atrium, leading to a defect in the atrial septum and an increased risk of anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Rationale: Cholera is a diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which is typically found in contaminated food and water. In Africa, cholera outbreaks are often linked to poor sanitation, inadequate access to clean water, and inadequate hygiene practices. When human waste is not properly disposed of, it can contaminate water sources, leading to the spread of cholera.

E.  A fecalith in the left lower quadrant

###Answer:",B,"This patient has symptoms consistent with obstruction, most likely due to an incarcerated hernia.

Abdominal radiographs would most likely show dilated loops of the bowel. The presence of valvulae conniventes and a greater than 2 cm height difference on the same loop of the bowel but at different heights favor small bowel obstruction.

With strangulation, perforation may occur, which may cause free intraperitoneal air and an exam consistent with peritonitis.

In assessing plain film findings for bowel obstruction, having an upright or decubitus view is typically helpful to visualize air-fluid levels. Asymmetric air-fluid levels are said in some texts to help differentiate obstruction from ileus, though not all texts agree.",A fecalith in the right lower quadrant,Predominantly central dilated loops,Absence of valvulae conniventes,Presence of less than 2 cm height difference on the same loop of the bowel but at different heights,A fecalith in the left lower quadrant,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest small bowel obstruction (SBO). The presence of a mass in the right groin that cannot be reduced suggests an incarcerated inguinal hernia, which is a common cause of SBO. The patient's history of emphysema and home oxygen therapy is incidental. On abdominal radiographs, the diagnosis of SBO is supported by the presence of dilated loops of bowel with an abrupt cutoff, and the ""step ladder"" pattern, which is characterized by a difference of less than 2 cm in height on the same loop of bowel at different heights. This pattern is seen in SBO due to the uniform caliber of the small intestine. Fecaliths are seen in sigmoid volvulus, not SBO. Valvulae conniventes are folds of the mucosa and submucosa that are seen in the small intestine, but their absence is not a diagnostic feature of SBO.",False,model6

Rationale: Acute gastroenteritis is a common illness in children, characterized by diarrhea and/or vomiting. In most cases, it is caused by viral infections and is self-limiting. The primary treatment for uncomplicated acute gastroenteritis in children is oral rehydration solution (ORS), which helps to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. ORS is effective in preventing dehydration and reducing the risk of complications. Antibiotics are not indicated in viral gastroenteritis, and antiviral medications are usually reserved for specific viral infections such as rotavirus.

A.  Low amplitude ECG
B.  Electrical alternans
C.  Pulsus paradoxus
D.  Raised plasma lactate
E.  Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. A large pericardial effusion reduces the amplitude of the ECG as the myocardial tissue is further away from the recording electrodes. The heart may rotate within the pericardial sac so that there is a motion artefact on the ECG (electrical alternans). There may be an increased fall in blood pressure on inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) as the increased venous return to the right heart causes the septum to bulge into the left ventricle, impeding cardiac output. Concave ST elevation in a pattern that does not correspond to coronary ischaemia is typical of pericarditis, which may be complicated by pericardial tamponade. Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF is typical of an inferior myocardial infarction.

###Answer:",A,"Because DD has diabetes, he has a compelling indication for an ACE inhibitor or ARB for the treatment of his hypertension and prevention of diabetic nephropathy. However, most ACE inhibitors undergo hepatic conversion to active metabolites, so his hepatic impairment is of concern. Because lisinopril is one of the two ACE inhibitors that does not undergo hepatic conversion to active metabolites, it is the best choice. Fosinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that is not eliminated primarily by the kidneys but does undergo hepatic conversion. An additional diuretic like spironolactone or furosemide is not indicated. DD does not have a compelling indication for hydralazine",Lisinopril,Spironolactone,Fosinopril,Furosemide,Hydralazine,A,"A

Rationale: In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors are preferred for the treatment of hypertension. Lisinopril is a suitable option for this patient. Thiazide diuretics are also a good choice in patients with diabetes and hypertension. However, in patients with liver impairment, thiazides may worsen the liver function, so close monitoring is required. Spironolactone is not a good option as it is contraindicated in liver disease. Fosinopril is also an ACE inhibitor, but it is not a better option than lisinopril. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and is not a good choice in this patient. Hydralazine is a vasodilator and may cause reflex tachycardia, which is not desirable in patients with hypertension.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium. It is prevalent in various regions of Africa and is transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria can lead to symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and, in severe cases, enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), as well as complications such as anemia and cerebral malaria. Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma and primarily affects the liver and intestines.",Schistosomiasis,Filariasis,Malaria,Toxoplasmosis,Trypanosomiasis,C,"C. Malaria

Rationale: Malaria is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease caused by a protozoan parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasite, Plasmodium, multiplies in the liver and then infects red blood cells, leading to their rupture and the release of more parasites into the bloodstream. The symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, as well as abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells. The liver and spleen may become enlarged as they work to filter out the parasites and damaged red blood cells from the bloodstream. Malaria is prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.",True,model6

Rationale: Splenic sequestration crisis is a common complication of untreated sickle cell disease in African populations. In the first decade of life, children with sickle cell disease are at risk for splenic sequestration crisis, which can lead to rapid splenic enlargement, anemia, and cardiovascular instability. This complication is more common in African populations than in those of African-Caribbean descent. Aplastic crisis is a rare complication of sickle cell disease, often caused by parvovirus B19 infection. Acute chest syndrome is a common complication of sickle cell disease, but it is not more common in African populations.

###Options:
A.  ACE inhibitor
B.  Thiazide
C.  Acetaminophen
D.  Calcium channel blocker
E.  Loop diuretics

###Answer:",D,"This patient has newly diagnosed, acute heart failure.

Acute heart failure can be precipitated or exacerbated by beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, and alcohol.

Increasing cardiac output is the main goal of therapy for a patient with congestive heart failure (CHF).

In the long-term management of CHF, diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, hydralazine plus nitrate, digoxin, and aldosterone antagonists can improve CHF symptoms depending on the severity of the heart failure.",ACE inhibitor,Thiazide,Acetaminophen,Calcium channel blocker,Loop diuretics,D,"D. Calcium channel blocker

Rationale: Calcium channel blockers, particularly verapamil and diltiazem, can precipitate acute heart failure in susceptible individuals, especially the elderly. They can decrease contractility and slow heart rate, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased fluid retention. This is especially true in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. The other options are less likely to cause acute heart failure. ACE inhibitors and loop diuretics are often used to treat heart failure, thiazides are used to treat hypertension, and acetaminophen is an analgesic with no direct effect on the heart.",True,model6

Rationale: 
Febrile seizures are a type of seizure that occurs in children in association with a fever, typically between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. They are usually generalized seizures, meaning they affect both sides of the brain. Option A is incorrect because febrile seizures can occur with other conditions that cause fever, not just elevated temperature.

Rationale: Portal hypertension is a major complication of cirrhosis of liver. It is characterized by increased blood pressure in the portal vein, which can lead to various complications, including splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), ascites (fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity), and esophageal varices (dilated veins in the esophagus). Splenomegaly is an important physical sign of portal hypertension, as it is a direct consequence of the increased blood pressure in the portal vein, which leads to congestion and enlargement of the spleen.

###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:",A,Prompt diagnosis and treatment of TB cases help prevent transmission of the bacteria to others and reduce the risk of developing drug-resistant strains.,True,False,,,,A,"A

Rationale: Early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are essential for preventing the spread of the disease within communities. TB is an infectious disease that can be spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The bacteria can remain suspended in the air for several hours, making it easy for others to inhale them and become infected. If left untreated, a person with active TB can infect 10-15 people per year. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in breaking the chain of transmission and preventing the spread of the disease. Effective treatment not only cures the individual but also renders them non-infectious, thereby preventing further transmission.",True,model6

He has previously undergone a splenectomy secondary to sickle cell disease. On examination, hes found to be tachycardic. Abdominal examination reveals guarding. An ultrasound scan shows gall stones in the gall bladder, free fluid in the pelvis and an appendix with a diameter of 8 mm.What is the most probable diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Sickle Cell Crisis
B.  Impacted Gall Stone
C.  Cholecystitis
D.  Acute Appendicitis
E.  Gastroenteritis

###Answer:",D,"Based on the clinical scenario, the most probable diagnosis is acute appendicitis.Acute appendicitis presents typically with central abdominal pain migrating to the right iliac fossa, anorexia, nausea and fever. The temperature usually does not go beyond 40C. Although appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis, an ultrasound scan showing an appendix width of greater than 6mm is diagnostic.Pyrexia, guarding, and pain are all in keeping with appendicitis.Other options:- Cholecystitis is very rare in children, and although gall stones are present, there is no jaundice or biliary tree dilatation suggested by the scan.- Impacted Gall Stone: There is no mention of common bile duct dilatation in the clinical scenario.- Sickle Cell Crisis: A sickle cell crisis should not cause guarding, or an ultrasound scan finding of a dilated appendix base.- Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis would not produce the ultrasound scan findings described above with a thickened appendix.",Sickle Cell Crisis,Impacted Gall Stone,Cholecystitis,Acute Appendicitis,Gastroenteritis,D,"D. Acute Appendicitis

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including acute abdominal pain, fever, and guarding, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The ultrasound finding of an 8 mm appendix diameter supports this diagnosis. The presence of gallstones and free fluid in the pelvis may be incidental findings, but they do not explain the patient's acute symptoms. Sickle cell crisis is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an acute abdomen. Cholecystitis is also possible, but the ultrasound finding of an enlarged appendix makes acute appendicitis a more likely diagnosis. Gastroenteritis is unlikely given the patient's guarding and ultrasound findings.",True,model6

D.  The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in  response to a sudden drop in blood pressure
E.  The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.

###Answer:",B,"When there is a sudden drop in blood pressure, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain, and the brain activates the sympathetic system (not the parasympathetic system) to restore blood pressure to normal values.",Baroreceptors are pressure sensors located at  various cardiovascular sites.,The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden drop in blood pressure,The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden increase in blood  pressure.,The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in  response to a sudden drop in blood pressure,"The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.",B,"B

Rationale: The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in response to a sudden drop in blood pressure, not the parasympathetic system. The sympathetic system helps to increase blood pressure by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction, whereas the parasympathetic system has a more prominent role in decreasing blood pressure.

Rationale: The tuberculin test, also known as the Mantoux test, is a diagnostic tool used to determine whether a person has been infected with tuberculosis. However, it is not a diagnostic method for confirming the presence of tuberculosis, but rather a screening test to identify individuals who have been infected with M. tuberculosis. The other options are all diagnostic methods used to confirm the presence of tuberculosis. Gene X-pert is a nucleic acid amplification test that can detect M. tuberculosis DNA in clinical specimens.

D.  Placenta previae
E.  Recurrent abortion

###Answer:",A,"Correct Answer
A. Spontaneous abortion
Explanation
The most likely cause of the symptoms described in the question is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage. Vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps are common signs of a miscarriage, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This occurs when the pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week. It is important for the woman to seek medical attention in order to confirm the diagnosis and receive appropriate care",Spontaneous abortion,Abruptio placenta,Ovarian torsion,Placenta previae,Recurrent abortion,A,"A

Rationale: 
Spontaneous abortion is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps in the first trimester of pregnancy. It is defined as the termination of pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation, and it occurs in up to 20% of all pregnancies. The symptoms of spontaneous abortion include vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and passage of tissue from the uterus. In this scenario, the patient is 10 weeks pregnant and is experiencing vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps, which are consistent with spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placenta is a condition that occurs later in pregnancy, typically after 20 weeks of gestation, and is characterized by vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a condition that occurs when the ovary twists, cutting off its blood supply, and is typically associated with severe abdominal pain. Placenta previae is a condition that occurs later in pregnancy, typically after 20 weeks of gestation, and is characterized by vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain. Recurrent abortion is a condition that occurs when a woman has three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions, and is not typically associated with abdominal cramps.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
B.  Excision of the omental metastasis and ovarian cystectomy
C.  Omentectomy and ovarian cystectomy
D.  Excision of the omental metastasis and unilateral oophorectomy
E.  Omentectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

###Answer:",A,"The survival rates of women diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma are closely linked to the extent of residual tumor tissue left after the initial surgical intervention. During laparotomy, it's crucial to meticulously identify and remove all resectable tumor masses. Despite the apparent normalcy of the uterus and ovaries, there exists a notable occurrence of hidden metastases to these organs. Hence, it's advisable to remove them during the primary surgery. Ovarian cancer metastasizes beyond the peritoneum through the pelvic or para-aortic lymphatic pathways, subsequently spreading to the thoracic region and other parts of the body.","Omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy",Excision of the omental metastasis and ovarian cystectomy,Omentectomy and ovarian cystectomy,Excision of the omental metastasis and unilateral oophorectomy,Omentectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,A,"A. Omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

Rationale: The presence of a unilateral ovarian neoplasm alongside a large omental metastasis, with a frozen section diagnosis confirming metastatic serous cystadenocarcinoma, strongly suggests that the patient has advanced ovarian cancer. The standard surgical approach for advanced ovarian cancer includes a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. This is because ovarian cancer often spreads to the uterus, fallopian tubes, and omentum. Removing these structures can help improve the patient's prognosis and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate course of action.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Hemolysis
B.  Thrombosis
C.  Septicemia
D.  Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
E.  e) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is (C) Septicemia. Septicemia occurs when bacteria present in donor blood enter the recipient's bloodstream during a transfusion, leading to systemic infection.",Hemolysis,Thrombosis,Septicemia,Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI),e) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO),C,"C

Rationale: A transfusion reaction caused by bacterial contamination of donor blood is known as septicemia. This occurs when bacteria present in the donated blood are transfused into the recipient, causing a severe systemic infection. Hemolysis refers to the breakdown of red blood cells, which can occur due to a transfusion reaction caused by ABO incompatibility. Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot, which is not directly related to transfusion reactions. TRALI is a rare but serious complication of blood transfusion, characterized by acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. TACO is a condition that occurs when a patient receives too much blood too quickly, leading to circulatory overload.",True,model6

He has been feeling unwell for the past 3 weeks, with fevers, headaches and tiredness. His mother is concerned that he has been getting worse over time instead of better. He looks very pale and has many bruises and petechiae on his arms and legs, which have appeared spontaneously over the past week. Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged liver and spleen. An urgent full blood count shows: haemoglobin 68g/L (normal 120-180), platelets 25 (normal 150-450), white cell count 83 (normal 3.4-11.0). What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?
###Options:
A.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
B.  Aplastic anaemia
C.  Epstein-Barr virus
D.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
E.  Lymphoma

###Answer:",A,"This is a presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This boy is anaemic and thrombocytopenic, which together suggests a problem in the bone marrow. The high white cell count, fevers, headaches and hepatosplenomegaly point towards leukaemia. Aplastic anaemia would cause a low white cell count. ITP would cause low platelets, but the boy would otherwise be well. Although lymphoma could cause a high WCC, lymphadenopathy would be expected. Epstein-Barr virus could cause many of the boys symptoms, but would generally cause lymphadenopathy too and not anaemia or thrombocytopenia",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Aplastic anaemia,Epstein-Barr virus,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Lymphoma,A,"A.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Rationale: The symptoms and signs described in this case, including fever, headaches, tiredness, pallor, bruising and petechiae, are all consistent with a diagnosis of acute leukaemia. The full blood count results show a low haemoglobin, low platelet count, and a very high white cell count, which is also consistent with this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of an enlarged liver and spleen also support this diagnosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood leukaemia, and it typically presents with symptoms and signs similar to those described in this case. While the other options could potentially cause some of the symptoms and signs described, they are less likely to cause the full range of symptoms and signs described, and are not as consistent with the full blood count results.",True,model6

Which of the following is the most likely complication to develop in the patient?
###Options:
A.  Lactic acidosis
B.  Septic shock
C.  Psueodocyst
D.  Renal failure
E.  hyperurucemia

###Answer:",C,"The vignette represents a classical presentation of acute pancreatitis with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back and is associated with nausea and vomiting which is relieved by bending forward. Elevation in serum lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pathophysiology of pancreatitis involves both the localized destruction in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response. The inciting event is the premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the acinar cell.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is defined by the Revised Atlanta Classification and requires at least 2 of 3 criteria be met: 1) a lipase or amylase level that is three times the upper limit of normal 2) abdominal pain that is consistent with pancreatitis 3) abdominal imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. A pseudocyst, the most likely complication, is a walled-off fluid collection seen after 4 weeks of an acute episode.

Management for acute pancreatitis includes early aggressive fluid resuscitation and nutrition. Mortality is 1% to 2%. Most of thee pseudocysts resolve with observation alone with periodic follow-up using CT or MRI. Drainage is only recommended in symptomatic, infected or rapidly enlarging pseudocysts.

Perform a throat culture

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a bacterial pharyngitis, such as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). The rapid antigen test is not 100% sensitive, so a throat culture is the next step to confirm the diagnosis. The presence of exudates, tender cervical nodes, and the absence of cough support this diagnosis. Antibiotics should not be started empirically without a confirmed diagnosis.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of spinal cord injury, specifically anterior spinal artery syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by loss of motor function and pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion, but preservation of proprioceptive and fine touch sensations. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. In addition to the neurologic symptoms, the patient is also experiencing urinary retention, which is a common complication of spinal cord injury.

###Options:
A.  Finasteride
B.  Fadrozole
C.  Clomiphene citrate
D.  Letrozole
E.  progesterone

###Answer:",D,"Adjuvant chemotherapy prevents breast cancer recurrence and is indicated in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptive breast cancer with a mass of >1 cm at diagnosis or evidence of metastasis. An increase in cells that express ER is present in a majority of breast cancers. Therefore, a variety of pharmacologic agents have been developed to decrease estrogen production and activity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (like tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (like anastrozole) are approved for use in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer because of their mechanisms related to decreasing estrogen levels.

Letrozole and anastrozole are both third-generation aromatase inhibitors that are the most specific toward targeting aromatase and are the most appropriate drugs of choice when choosing aromatase Inhibitors.

Fadrozole is a second-generation aromatase inhibitor that exhibited less specificity for the enzyme aromatase and has an increase of adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rashes, etc. in comparison to third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Clomiphene citrate is a drug that induces ovulation in patients with infertility or PCOS.",Finasteride,Fadrozole,Clomiphene citrate,Letrozole,progesterone,D,"D. Letrozole

Rationale: The patient has an estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Estrogen receptor positive breast cancers are more common in postmenopausal women and are often treated with aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, work by blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues, thereby reducing the amount of estrogen available to stimulate the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Fadrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, but it is not commonly used. Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to induce ovulation in infertility treatment. Progesterone would stimulate the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells, so it would not be an appropriate treatment.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Hyperthyroidism
B.  Simple goitre
C.  Riedels thyroiditis
D.  Thyroid carcinoma
E.  Thyroid cyst

Riedels thyroiditis (C) is a rare inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland that is characterized by fibrosis of the thyroid gland and other structures in the neck. It is often stony or woody on palpation and patients are usually asymptomatic. The patient does not have any features of hyperthyroidism (A) in which a thyroid bruit can be present. A thyroid cyst or nodule (E) is usually harmless and is a fluid-filled swelling often presenting as a single compressible small lump rather than a diffuse swelling. A full history and examination should always be conducted with ultrasound and fine needle examination to exclude malignancy.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a simple goitre, which is a benign enlargement of the thyroid gland. The diffuse swelling, lack of bruit, and the patient's age are all indicative of this diagnosis. The patient's irritability is likely related to the goitre rather than hyperthyroidism, which would typically present with more pronounced symptoms such as weight loss, tremors, and heat intolerance. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare condition that presents with a hard, woody thyroid gland, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Thyroid carcinoma is possible but less likely given the patient's age and the lack of other symptoms.

An x-ray of his right hand shows widening of the epiphyseal plate, and lab results confirm a vitamin deficiency. Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?
###Options:
A.  Kidney
B.  Pancreas
C.  Bone marrow
D.  Lungs
E.  heart

###Answer:",A,"This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered. Once the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended",Kidney,Pancreas,Bone marrow,Lungs,heart,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with rickets, a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is activated by hydroxylation reactions in the liver and kidneys. The kidney is responsible for the final step of activation, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of the vitamin. This active form plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate metabolism, which is essential for bone growth and development.",True,model6

###Answer:",E,") In serous cystadenocarcinoma, more than three cell layers of stratification exist in the epithelial cell lining. The individual cells are atypical, and there is invasion of the ovarian stroma and/or protrusion from the capsule (excrescences). A borderline malignant tumor has three or fewer cells in the lining of the cyst and no evidence of invasion.

Rationale: 
The description of numerous cysts lined by serous epithelium with marked cytologic atypia, and nests of similar cells in the ovarian stroma, indicates a borderline ovarian tumor. The presence of round laminated calcium bodies, known as psammoma bodies, is a characteristic feature of serous tumors. The degree of atypia and the presence of cells in the stroma rule out a benign serous cystadenoma. The absence of stromal invasion rules out a carcinoma.",False,model6

C.  Conjugated equine estrogens
D.  OC pills
E.  Transdermal estradiol

###Answer:",D,"ral contraceptive (OC) pills are a common treatment option for abnormal uterine bleeding. They contain synthetic hormones that help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce bleeding. OC pills can help stabilize the endometrium and prevent excessive growth, which can be beneficial for patients with prothrombin deficiency.

Rationale: The patient is likely experiencing bleeding due to a coagulopathy. The most effective way to control bleeding in this situation is to use a combination hormonal therapy, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which contain both estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen component will help to stabilize the clotting cascade, while the progesterone component will help to regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent further bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (option B) is a progesterone-only medication that may help to regulate the menstrual cycle but will not address the underlying coagulopathy. GnRH antagonists (option A) are used to treat conditions such as endometriosis and fibroids, but are not typically used to control bleeding. Conjugated equine estrogens (option C) are a form of estrogen replacement therapy, but may exacerbate bleeding in this situation.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including severe pain in her hands and feet, pale appearance, and multiple areas of bone tenderness, are consistent with a vaso-occlusive crisis, which is a common complication of sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells can occlude small blood vessels, leading to tissue ischemia and pain. This is the most likely cause of her pain.

E.  none

###Answer:",C,"In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a soft tissue infection, likely cellulitis or abscess formation, around the puncture wound. The presence of fever with shaking chills, lethargy, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot are indicative of systemic involvement, suggesting a more severe infection.Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease, they are at an increased risk of infections due to impaired immune function and compromised blood flow to tissues, which can predispose them to complications such as osteomyelitis or septicemia.The characteristic warm, swollen, and extremely tender area around the wound suggests a bacterial infection, and the likely causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that commonly causes skin and soft tissue infections. The presence of coagulase, an enzyme that enables the bacterium to form clots, helps in its identification. Staphylococcus aureus typically appears as gram-positive cocci in clusters on Gram stain, hence the correct option is c) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters.This explanation aligns with the clinical presentation and common microbiological characteristics associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections.","Catalase-positive, gram-negative cocobacilli","Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli",none,A,"A

C.  preterm labor
D.  Braxton-hicks contractions
E.  premature labor

###Answer:",A,"Correct Answer
A. Imminet delivery
Explanation
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing contractions that are 2 minutes apart and feeling an urge to move her bowels. These are signs of imminent delivery, indicating that she is likely in active labor and will give birth soon.",Imminent delivery,Stage one labor,preterm labor,Braxton-hicks contractions,premature labor,A,"A. Imminent delivery

Rationale: The patient is at 39 weeks of gestation, which is full term. She has been experiencing contractions for 45 minutes, and they are 2 minutes apart, indicating that labor is progressing rapidly. The patient's urge to move her bowels is a classic symptom of fetal descent into the pelvis, which is a sign of imminent delivery. This, combined with the rapid progression of contractions, suggests that delivery is likely to occur soon.",True,model6

B.  Mutation in the Â±-globin gene
C.  Deletion of the Â³-globin gene
D.  Overexpression of the Â´-globin gene
E.  Mutation in the hemoglobin A gene

###Answer:",A,"Correct answer: A) Mutation in the Â²-globin geneExplanation: Sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation in the Â²-globin gene on chromosome 11, leading to the substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the sixth position of the Â²-globin chain. This mutation results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. Options B, C, D, and E do not accurately represent the primary genetic defect associated with sickle cell disease.",Mutation in the Â²-globin gene,Mutation in the Â±-globin gene,Deletion of the Â³-globin gene,Overexpression of the Â´-globin gene,Mutation in the hemoglobin A gene,A,"A. Mutation in the Â²-globin gene

Rationale: Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The primary genetic defect underlying sickle cell disease is a point mutation in the Â²-globin gene, which codes for the Â²-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at the sixth position of the Â²-globin chain, resulting in the production of HbS. The other options are not correct because mutations in the Â±-globin gene are associated with Â±-thalassemia, deletion of the Â³-globin gene is associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, overexpression of the Â´-globin gene is associated with Â´-Â²-thalassemia, and mutation in the hemoglobin A gene is not a recognized genetic defect.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) help lower blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart.,Insulin,Antibiotics,ACE inhibitors,Antidepressants,Antihistamines,C,"C.  ACE inhibitors

Rationale: ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are a type of medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). They work by relaxing blood vessels, which helps to lower blood pressure. ACE inhibitors do this by blocking the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, a chemical that constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. This relaxation of blood vessels reduces the pressure on the heart and improves blood flow to the body. Examples of ACE inhibitors include enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril.",True,model6

E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"Long-acting morphine is the most cost-effective choice for long-acting analgesic medication in this patient because he requires a long-acting medication for pain control. Since his current health insurance does not include a pharmacy benefit, cost-effectiveness is an important consideration. Long-acting morphine is a commonly used and cost-effective option for managing severe pain in patients with cancer.

Rationale: 
Long-acting morphine is the most cost-effective option for this patient. Morphine is a generic medication available in both short-acting and long-acting formulations. It is a widely used and effective medication for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including cancer-related pain. In this scenario, the patient has already demonstrated a need for opioid therapy and has been using short-acting narcotics regularly. Switching to a long-acting formulation would provide more consistent pain control and potentially reduce the frequency of dosing. The other options, including long-acting oxycodone, transdermal fentanyl, and duloxetine, are more expensive brand-name medications that may not be as affordable for this patient without a pharmacy benefit.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,It is the only thyroid swelling with irregular surface..,thyroiditis,Graves disease,Toxic thyroid,multinodular thyroid,none of the above,D,"D

Rationale: The presence of anterior neck swelling with palpitation and an irregular surface suggests a multinodular thyroid gland. A multinodular thyroid gland is a condition where the thyroid gland is enlarged and contains multiple nodules, which can cause palpitation and an irregular surface. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, but it typically presents with a diffuse goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) rather than a multinodular gland.

Respiratory distress in a premature infant.

Rationale: 
The biggest problem with inducing preterm labor is the risk of respiratory distress in the premature infant.

For a 22-kg infant:

The first 10 kg would require 100 mL/kg * 10 kg = 1000 mL.
The next 10 kg would require 50 mL/kg * 10 kg = 500 mL.
The remaining 2 kg would require 20 mL/kg * 2 kg = 40 mL.
Adding these together: 1000 mL + 500 mL + 40 mL = 1540 mL.

So, the maintenance daily fluid requirement for a 22-kg infant is approximately 1550 mL, which corresponds to option c.

E.  Onchocerciasis

###Answer:",B,"African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies. It is prevalent in certain regions of Africa, particularly in rural areas where tsetse flies are present. The disease progresses through two stages: an early hemolymphatic stage characterized by fever, headaches, and joint pain, followed by a late meningoencephalitic stage involving neurological symptoms such as sleep disturbances, confusion, and coma. Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and transmitted by triatomine bugs. Leishmaniasis is caused by various species of the Leishmania parasite and transmitted by sandflies. Onchocerciasis is caused by the Onchocerca volvulus parasite and transmitted by blackflies.",Malaria,African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness),Chagas disease,Leishmaniasis,Onchocerciasis,B,"B

Rationale: African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies, which are found in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, joint pain, and swelling of the lymph nodes, and can progress to involve the central nervous system, leading to sleep disturbances, confusion, and eventually death if left untreated.",True,model6

He appears pale and has prominent maxillary bones. He has a history of receiving multiple blood transfusions for thalassemia major. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be found in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes
B.  Bone marrow biopsy showing ringed sideroblasts
C.  Heinz bodies within RBCs and bite cells
D.  Peripheral blood smear showing microcytic RBCs with target cells
E.  Bone marrow biopsy showing round sideroblasts

###Answer:",D,"Peripheral blood smear showing microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with target cells is the typical picture of a patient with thalassemia.

Target cells are formed due to the accumulation of hemoglobin at the center of RBCs. These cells are formed in thalassemia, functional or anatomical asplenia, liver disease, and hemoglobin C disease.

Ringed sideroblasts on peripheral blood smear and basophilic stripling on bone marrow biopsy are diagnostic findings of sideroblastic anemia. Basophilic stripling is also found in lead poisoning and myelodysplastic syndromes.

Heinz bodies within RBCs and bite cells are found in G6PD deficiency. Spherocytes are seen in hereditary spherocytosis and hemolytic diseases.",Peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes,Bone marrow biopsy showing ringed sideroblasts,Heinz bodies within RBCs and bite cells,Peripheral blood smear showing microcytic RBCs with target cells,Bone marrow biopsy showing round sideroblasts,D,"D

Rationale: The patient is likely to have iron overload due to multiple blood transfusions for thalassemia major. The peripheral blood smear would show microcytic RBCs with target cells, indicating the presence of iron overload. The other options are not directly related to iron overload. Option A is seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, option B is seen in sideroblastic anemia, option C is seen in G6PD deficiency, and option E is seen in myelodysplastic syndrome.",True,model6

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mitral regurgitation and received a mitral valve replacement 3 months ago. The patient states that he also has lesions around his fingers that are painful. Vital signs are temperature 101 Â°F, heart rate 110 bpm and tachycardic, and blood pressure 160/78 mm Hg. A physical examination is notable for a murmur in the apex with tender nodules in his hands bilaterally. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12,000/Â¼L. What is the next best choice of management for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Blood cultures
B.  Echocardiogram
C.  Skin biopsy of the lesions
D.  Antihypertensive medications for elevated blood pressure
E.  CBC

###Answer:",A,"This patient presents with prosthetic valve endocarditis likely from recent mitral valve replacement, in which symptoms can present with fever, generalized weakness, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, and Roth spots.

One of the most common types of bacteria found on the prosthetic valve endocarditis is Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The first part of management in patients with endocarditis is to obtain blood cultures. Two sets of cultures are recommended because coagulase-negative staphylococci is a common contaminant. The use of multiple blood cultures improves positive predictive outcomes.

After the blood cultures are obtained, it is important to start empiric antibiotics. Empiric coverage using vancomycin is recommended if S epidermidis infection is suspected.",Blood cultures,Echocardiogram,Skin biopsy of the lesions,Antihypertensive medications for elevated blood pressure,CBC,A,"A. Blood cultures

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with endocarditis. The patient has a prosthetic valve, which increases the risk of endocarditis. The presence of painful nodules on his hands, known as Osler's nodes, is a classic finding in endocarditis. The next best step is to obtain blood cultures to diagnose the infection and identify the causative organism. This will guide further management and treatment. An echocardiogram (Option B) may be useful in evaluating the valve for signs of infection, but it should not be done before blood cultures are obtained. A skin biopsy (Option C) may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of Osler's nodes but is not the next best step. Antihypertensive medications (Option D) may be necessary to control the patient's blood pressure, but they should not be the primary focus at this time. A complete blood count (Option E) may show leukocytosis, but it will not provide specific information to guide management.",True,model6

Rationale: 
The patient is a 35-year-old pregnant woman with a BMI of 40, which makes her more susceptible to benign flow murmurs. The presence of a grade III/VI murmur along the mid left sternal edge without any other cardiorespiratory signs further supports this diagnosis. Benign flow murmurs are common during pregnancy due to increased blood volume and cardiac output. They are usually systolic, grade I-III, and heard along the left sternal edge.

The parents report low-grade fever for the last three days. He also refuses to eat to drink milk and has no appetite. Fever is recorded as 100 F, blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg, and the pulse is 100/min. On chest examination, there is inspiratory stridor. He is bottle-fed and has had many missed vaccination appointments in the past. He was born in the hospital via C-section and had normal development after birth. A complete blood count is ordered and shows leucocytosis. A lateral neck x-ray reveals a characteristic cherry-shaped swelling. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Croup
B.  Epiglottitis
C.  Tonsillitis
D.  Foreign body obstruction
E.  pharygitis

###Answer:",B,"This patient has epiglottitis. It is very common in children 1-3 years of age and is due to Haemophilus influenza type b in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children.

The affected child has a toxic/pale/cyanotic look and adopts a tripod position in an attempt to open the airway fully. On examination, there is fever (57%), stridor (81%), respiratory distress (78%), sore throat (65%), drooling (42%), painful swallowing (49%), tender neck (65%), altered voice (33%), cervical adenopathy (39%), and sometimes cough.

CBC may or may not show leucocytosis. Later neck x-ray shows 'thumb sign' or a 'cherry-shaped' epiglottic swelling.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of stridor, refusal to eat or drink, and fever suggest an upper airway obstruction. The lateral neck x-ray showing a cherry-shaped swelling is consistent with epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is an acute infection of the epiglottis, which can cause sudden onset of stridor, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. The patient's history of missed vaccinations and being bottle-fed may have increased his risk for developing epiglottitis. In contrast, croup typically presents with a barking cough and a steeple sign on x-ray, while tonsillitis and pharyngitis are typically associated with exudates and swollen tonsils. Foreign body obstruction would not typically present with fever and would have a different x-ray appearance.",True,model6

A.  Plasmodium falciparum
B.  Plasmodium knowlesi
C.  Plasmodium malariae
D.  Plasmodium ovale
E.  Plasmodium vivax

###Answer:",A,"This is a presentation of severe malaria associated with end organ dysfunction. This, in conjunction with the irregular, daily pattern of fever is consistent with plasmodium falciparum infection.

The answer is A.",Plasmodium falciparum,Plasmodium knowlesi,Plasmodium malariae,Plasmodium ovale,Plasmodium vivax,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is presenting with fever, general malaise, and hypoglycemia, which are all symptoms of malaria. The fact that the fever is relapsing and remitting in an irregular pattern suggests that the patient may have Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which is known to cause irregular fever patterns. Additionally, the patient's development of a seizure and profound hypoglycemia further support this diagnosis, as P. falciparum is known to cause cerebral malaria and hypoglycemia. While the other options are all species of Plasmodium that can cause malaria, they are less likely to cause the severe symptoms described in this patient.",True,model6

After confirmation of intrauterine pregnancy, patients should be started on prenatal vitamins (if not already taken) and undergo a physical examination, laboratory testing, and counseling regarding the expected prenatal course.

Patients presenting with the first positive pregnancy test without confirmed intrauterine pregnancy must be worked up and evaluated for other signs and symptoms to rule out ""pregnancy of unknown location"" or ectopic pregnancy. This includes sonography to confirm location.

Rationale: The patient is a healthy young woman with a normal pregnancy at 8 weeks and 3 days gestation. She has no complaints or issues and is taking prenatal vitamins. The best initial step in this patient's care is reassurance. There is no indication for further testing or intervention at this time. A transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound may be performed to confirm the gestational age and fetal viability, but this is not necessary in this patient.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, and joint pain, are consistent with a rickettsial infection. The presence of a rash that started on the legs and spread to the arms is also consistent with this diagnosis. Rickettsial fever, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, is a tick-borne illness that is commonly seen in the southeastern United States.

Rationale: The BCG vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine used in many countries to prevent tuberculosis. However, it can also cause a false-positive reaction to the Mantoux test, which is a skin test used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. To avoid false-positive results, an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) can be used instead of the Mantoux test.

Rationale: Acetylcholine (ACh) is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. It binds to muscarinic receptors, which are found in the heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine glands. In contrast, the sympathetic nervous system uses norepinephrine (NE) as its primary neurotransmitter, which binds to adrenergic receptors.

He first noted the mass 1 month ago. Two weeks ago, he was evaluated for an episode of prolongedepistaxis and was found to have a right ear effusion, which was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. He has no otherhistory of serious illness and takes no medications. Height is at the 10th percentile, weight is at the 50th percentile, andBMI is at the 75th percentile. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a right ear effusion anda 4-cm, firm mass in the right posterior triangle of the neck. Results of a biopsy specimen show squamous epitheliumwith indistinct cell margins, enlarged atypical nuclei, and absent keratin formation. Which of the following infectiousagents is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition?
###Options:
A.  Cytomegalovirus
B.  Epstein-Barr virus
C.  HIV
D.  Human herpesvirus 8

###Answer:",B,"The clinical presentation described, including the presence of a rapidly enlarging neck mass with histopathological findings of squamous epithelium with indistinct cell margins, enlarged atypical nuclei, and absent keratin formation, suggests a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma, also known as undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Undifferentiated NPC is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV is known to be closely linked to the pathogenesis of NPC, particularly the undifferentiated subtype, through its ability to infect and transform epithelial cells in the nasopharynx.Therefore, among the options provided, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition is:(B) Epstein-Barr virus",Cytomegalovirus,Epstein-Barr virus,HIV,Human herpesvirus 8,,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's presentation with a rapidly enlarging neck mass, ear effusion, and a history of epistaxis suggests a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The biopsy findings of squamous epithelium with indistinct cell margins, enlarged atypical nuclei, and absent keratin formation are consistent with this diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is thought to play a role in the development of the tumor. EBV is a common viral infection that is usually acquired in childhood, but it can also be acquired later in life. In some populations, particularly in Southeast Asia, EBV infection is a risk factor for the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",True,model6

Patients react differently to each trip and can experience bad and good trips on the same dosage.",Marijuana,Phencyclidine,Alcohol,Lysergic acid diethylamide,cocaine,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a hallucinogen overdose, specifically lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The patient's altered perception of colors and sounds, as well as his paranoia and abnormal gait, are all indicative of LSD use. The patient's vital signs are relatively normal, which is consistent with LSD, as it does not typically cause significant changes in vital signs. The patient's response bias scale (RBS) of 210 is also consistent with LSD use, as it indicates a high level of paranoia and suspiciousness.",True,model6

She has recently given birth to a healthy baby boy and is enjoying being a mother. However, she is becoming more reliant on her partner for support as she always feels exhausted and often becomes depressed. The patient has a poor appetite and often does not finish her meals, despite this she has gained 5 kg in the last 2 weeks. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Postpartum depression
B.  Eating disorder
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Occult malignancy

###Answer:",D,"Hypothyroidism (D) is a common disease with a higher prevalence in females and is usually a primary disorder affecting the thyroid gland itself. Thyroid hormones control the metabolic rate in many tissues, underactivity produces symptoms which are often insidious. These include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. The main causes include iodine deficiency, autoimmune pathology such as Hashimotos thyroiditis and, in females who have recently given birth, postpartum thyroiditis. Hyperthryoidism (C) results in an excess of thyroid hormones which inappropriately increases metabolic rate with symptoms such as weight loss, increased sweating, restlessness and palpitations. A goitre can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Postpartum depression (A) is often accompanied by confusion and is characterized by low mood, anhedonia and anergia. Severely affected patients can have delusional thoughts about their newborn child, such as it being evil, and even progress to thoughts of harming the child or suicidal ideation. Eating disorders (B), such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa, often result in drastic changes in body weight resulting from psychological problems with self-image and include behaviours such as self-induced vomiting to avoid weight gain or binge eating. Most malignancies (E) result in considerable weight loss though this is dependent on the type of cancer and often symptoms provide clues as to the location, e.g. neurological problems.",Postpartum depression,Eating disorder,Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Occult malignancy,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of tiredness, depression, poor appetite, and weight gain are consistent with hypothyroidism. The weight gain in particular is a key feature, as it is unusual for a woman to gain weight in the postpartum period. Hypothyroidism is a common condition that can occur in the postpartum period, and it is often underdiagnosed.

Legionella pneumophila

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, malaise, haemoptysis, and fever, are consistent with pneumonia. The recent move to a new building with unfinished water piping suggests that the patient may have been exposed to contaminated water, which is a risk factor for Legionella pneumophila infection. Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia.

###Answer:",C,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. The presence of serum antiparietal cell antibodies further supports the diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune condition affecting the gastric parietal cells and leading to impaired absorption of vitamin B12.Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Therefore, the impaired synthesis of methionine is most likely in this patient.So, the correct answer is:(C) Methionine",Cysteine,Glutamine,Methionine,Phenylalanine,Tyrosine,C,"C. Methionine

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine. In vitamin B12 deficiency, the synthesis of methionine is impaired, leading to increased levels of homocysteine.

He states that the pain is worse in the mornings and is relieved after meals. On direct questioning, there is no history of weight loss and the patients bowel habits are normal. On examination, his abdomen is soft and experiences moderate discomfort on palpation of the epigastric region. The most likely diagnosis is:

A.  Gastric ulcer
B.  Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
C.  Duodenal ulcer
D.  Gastric carcinoma
E.  Gastritis

###Answer:",C,"Although all of the answers may present with abdominal pain, the key to the answer is in the history. Duodenal ulcers (C), which are four times more common than gastric ulcers, classically present with abdominal pain which is usually relieved after meals or drinking milk. Gastric ulcers (A) on the other hand present with abdominal pain which tends to worsen after meals. In either duodenal/gastric ulcers, weight loss may be an associated symptom, but this is usually more common in gastric ulcers. Patients who suffer from GORD (B) usually experience retrosternal discomfort (heartburn) after meals and on lying flat. In addition, abdominal discomfort and pain in patients with gastritis (E) usually occurs after meals. Gastric carcinomas (D) tend to present with abdominal pain and drastic weight loss (e.g. 23 stone weight loss in the space of three months).",Gastric ulcer,Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD),Duodenal ulcer,Gastric carcinoma,Gastritis,C,"C. Duodenal ulcer

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are classic for peptic ulcer disease, specifically duodenal ulcer. The pain is epigastric, dull, and worse in the mornings, which is consistent with the natural acid production of the stomach. The relief of pain after meals is also consistent with duodenal ulcer, as food buffers the acid and provides temporary relief. The lack of weight loss and normal bowel habits make gastric carcinoma less likely. Gastritis may cause similar symptoms, but it is less likely to cause a consistent pattern of morning pain relief with meals. GORD typically causes burning retrosternal pain and is less likely to cause epigastric pain. Gastric ulcer pain is often relieved by antacids and food, but it is less likely to follow a consistent morning pattern.",True,model6

Rationale: The infection rates are high in wounds contaminated with bacteria, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract. The risk of wound infection is high in sigmoidectomy (colorectal surgery) and appendicectomy (appendix is a part of the gut). Cholecystectomy involves opening the gallbladder which is connected to the gut, so there is a risk of bacterial contamination. Prostatectomy involves opening the urinary tract, which is also contaminated with bacteria.

###Answer:",A,"Clinical features like fever, headache, vomiting along with neck rigidity on examination is diagnostic of meningitis.

Low CSF glucose level (<50 mg/dL) along with the neutrophilic predominance is suggestive of bacterial meningitis.

Neisseria meningitis is an encapsulated, gram-negative cocci in pair and is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and adolescents of age group 10-18 years.

Non-encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs are Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhea. Gram-positive cocci in a cluster are staphylococcus aureus.

A.  Temporal
B.  Frontal
C.  Occipital
D.  Parietal
E.  none of the above

###Answer:",B,"Schizophrenia is associated with hypo functionality (decreased functioning) of the frontal lobe on PET imaging. PET imaging is a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting the uptake of a radioactive tracer. Studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia often exhibit decreased metabolic activity in the frontal lobe, which is involved in various cognitive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and social behavior. This hypo functionality in the frontal lobe may contribute to the cognitive and behavioral symptoms observed in schizophrenia.",Temporal,Frontal,Occipital,Parietal,none of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Schizophrenia has been associated with hypofrontality, which refers to decreased activity in the frontal lobe of the brain. This is often seen on functional imaging studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The frontal lobe is involved in executive function, decision-making, and planning, and decreased activity in this region may contribute to the cognitive and behavioral impairments seen in schizophrenia.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,FANC emphasizes the preparation of an individualized birth plan during each antenatal visit ,Emphasises on risk identification and not disease detection,Preparation of the individual birth plan during all the visits,An assumption the current visit may be the last one,Sputum for AAFBs for all patients,none,C,"C.  An assumption the current visit may be the last one

Rationale: The Kenyan protocol for Focused Antenatal Care (FANC) emphasizes the importance of assuming that the current visit may be the last one, thus ensuring that all essential interventions are provided during each visit. This approach recognizes that some women may not return for subsequent visits, and therefore, it is crucial to provide comprehensive care during each encounter.",False,model6
fbea165f507566e246b4ca4ed35bda96d3bf5629a4e7893a9eb97be6330b253d,Internal_Medicine,"Question: A 19-year-old man who is a college freshman comes to the office because of a 4-day history of tender, swollen glands.He also has a 6-day history of fever, malaise, and decreased appetite. His temperature is 38.7Â°C (101.7Â°F). Physicalexamination shows swelling of the parotid glands. Which of the following infectious agents is the most likely cause ofthese findings?
###Options:
A.  Epstein-Barr virus
B.  Hepatitis B virus
C.  Measles virus
D.  Mumps virus
E.  Rubella virus

###Answer:",D,"Mumps is a contagious viral infection caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. It commonly presents with swelling of the parotid glands (parotitis), leading to the characteristic swollen cheeks or jaw. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and pain with swallowing.Given the swelling of the parotid glands observed during the physical examination, along with the constellation of symptoms described, mumps virus is the most likely infectious agent responsible for these findings.Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Mumps virus.",Epstein-Barr virus,Hepatitis B virus,Measles virus,Mumps virus,Rubella virus,D,"D. Mumps virus

Rationale: Mumps is an acute viral infection characterized by fever, headache, malaise, and swelling of one or both parotid glands. It is caused by the mumps virus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. The virus is highly contagious and is transmitted through respiratory droplets. The incubation period is typically 16-18 days, and the symptoms last for about 7-10 days. The patient's symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and swelling of the parotid glands, are consistent with mumps.",True,model6

E.  Gout

###Answer:",C,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown, resulting in joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.",Osteoporosis,Osteomyelitis,Osteoarthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Gout,C,"C. Osteoarthritis

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. It is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The condition typically affects weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, and spine, as well as the hands and fingers. While osteoporosis is a condition characterized by brittle bones, osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, and gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis, none of these conditions are characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage.",True,model6

He also has had loose, fatty, foul-smelling stoolsand a cough during the past 2 weeks. He is at the 30th percentile for height and 10th percentile for weight. Physicalexamination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show steatorrhea and a sweat chloride concentration of80 mmol/L. A chest x-ray shows hyperinflation. Sputum culture grows Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcusaureus. Secretion of which of the following substances is most likely to be decreased in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Bicarbonate
B.  Gastric acid
C.  Glucagon
D.  Insulin
E.  Intrinsic factor

###Answer:",A,"In cystic fibrosis, the CFTR dysfunction leads to impaired bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts, which results in thickening of pancreatic secretions, obstruction of the pancreatic ducts, and subsequent pancreatic insufficiency. This pancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to the clinical manifestation of steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools).Therefore, the substance most likely to be decreased in this patient is:(A) BicarbonateDecreased bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts contributes to the pathophysiology of steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis.",Bicarbonate,Gastric acid,Glucagon,Insulin,Intrinsic factor,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). In CF, there is a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is a chloride channel. This leads to a decrease in chloride secretion and an increase in sodium absorption in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. As a result, there is an increase in the concentration of chloride in sweat, which is why the sweat chloride concentration is elevated in this patient. In the pancreas, the decrease in chloride secretion leads to a decrease in bicarbonate secretion, which impairs the digestion of fats and proteins, leading to steatorrhea and malabsorption.",True,model6

Despite his young age, he exhibits signs of chronic liver disease, with a blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, a heart rate of 126 beats/min, and a pale appearance. Despite normal findings on rectal examination, he continues to vomit blood in the emergency room, prompting the placement of an artificial airway and the initiation of fluid resuscitation.
###Options:
A.  Gastric ulcer
B.  Gastric antral vascular lesion
C.  Esophageal varices
D.  Duodenal ulcer
E.  MalloryWeiss tear

###Answer:",C,"The probable cause of this substantial upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is esophageal varices resulting from portal hypertension. While MalloryWeiss tears are frequently observed in young patients who experience retching and vomiting, the history and severity of bleeding in this case make it less likely. Although bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers could manifest similarly, they are uncommon in young individuals without additional health issues.",Gastric ulcer,Gastric antral vascular lesion,Esophageal varices,Duodenal ulcer,MalloryWeiss tear,E,"E.  MalloryWeiss tear

Rationale: 
The patient's presentation with hematemesis, especially after a night of heavy drinking, is consistent with a Mallory-Weiss tear. This is a longitudinal laceration in the gastric mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction, which can occur after forceful vomiting or retching. The patient's signs of chronic liver disease and hypotension also support this diagnosis. While esophageal varices (C) are also a possibility, the patient's history of recent heavy drinking and vomiting makes a Mallory-Weiss tear more likely. Gastric ulcer (A) and duodenal ulcer (D) are less likely causes of hematemesis in this scenario, and gastric antral vascular lesions (B) are typically not associated with massive bleeding.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Parasitic infections
B.  Genetic disorders
C.  Tuberculosis
D.  HIV/AIDS
E.  Autoimmune disease

###Answer:",D,"HIV/AIDS is the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency in African populations. The virus can directly affect the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland, leading to reduced production of cortisol and other adrenal hormones. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and appropriate management can help address the condition.",Parasitic infections,Genetic disorders,Tuberculosis,HIV/AIDS,Autoimmune disease,D,"D. HIV/AIDS

Rationale: Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland, which regulates adrenal function, is damaged. In African populations, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency due to the high prevalence of HIV infection and the opportunistic infections that can damage the pituitary gland. Tuberculosis is also a common cause of adrenal insufficiency in African populations, but it is more likely to cause primary adrenal insufficiency due to adrenal gland destruction. The other options are less common causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency in African populations.",True,model6
