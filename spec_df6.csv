###Options:
A.  She probably has fibroids
B.  The woman's symptoms are most likely due to the presence of an arteriovenous malformation in the uterine wall.
C.  She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.
D.  She has engaged in energetic sexual intercourse

###Answer:",C,"In a postmenopausal woman, particularly one with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, there is a heightened risk of endometrial cancer that warrants investigation and exclusion.",She probably has fibroids,The woman's symptoms are most likely due to the presence of an arteriovenous malformation in the uterine wall.,"She should undergo evaluation with a pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound, and referral for endometrial sampling is necessary.",She has engaged in energetic sexual intercourse,,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is presenting with postmenopausal bleeding, which is bleeding that occurs more than 1 year after menopause. This is a common symptom of endometrial cancer, and therefore, the patient should undergo evaluation to rule out this possibility. The evaluation should include a pelvic examination, transvaginal ultrasound, and endometrial sampling. The other options are not accurate reflections of the management approach for this patient. Fibroids are a common cause of abnormal bleeding in premenopausal women but are less likely to cause bleeding in postmenopausal women. Arteriovenous malformations are rare and usually occur in younger women. Energetic sexual intercourse may cause vaginal trauma, but it would not typically cause bleeding that persists over time.",True,model6

He states that he prides himself on having a large appetite and ""holding his liquor"" during the holidays. He currently takes the maximum dose of omeprazole. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?
###Options:
A.  Ask the patient how much he is eating and drinking during the holidays
B.  Explain the hazards of untreated reflux in the presence of Barrett esophagus
C.  Order an upper endoscopy
D.  Switch the omeprazole to pantoprazole
E.  Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist

###Answer:",A,"Given the patient's symptoms worsening specifically during the holidays despite taking the maximum dose of omeprazole, it is important to assess potential contributing factors such as excessive eating and drinking, which can exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux. Understanding the patient's behavior during the holidays can guide further management decisions. Therefore, option (A) is the most appropriate initial action.",Ask the patient how much he is eating and drinking during the holidays,Explain the hazards of untreated reflux in the presence of Barrett esophagus,Order an upper endoscopy,Switch the omeprazole to pantoprazole,Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is experiencing breakthrough symptoms during the holiday season, which suggests that his lifestyle habits may be contributing to his symptoms. Before considering any changes to his medication regimen or ordering additional tests, the physician should explore the patient's eating and drinking habits during the holidays to identify potential triggers for his symptoms. This may include asking about the quantity and type of food and drinks he consumes, as well as any other factors that may be exacerbating his reflux.",True,model6

His history is significant for a trip to Nepal. Vital signs are temperature 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and blood pressure 108/74 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals icterus and splenomegaly. Laboratory results are hemoglobin 11 g/dL and the peripheral smear shows erythrocytes with brick-red granules. A presumptive diagnosis is made and the patient is hospitalized and started on appropriate therapy. On the 3rd hospital day, the develops a sudden increase in heart rate. An electrocardiogram is obtained (see below). What was the most likely drug administered?


###Options:
A.  Metronidazole
B.  Pyrimethamine
C.  ciprofloxacin
D.  Chloroquine
E.  Doxycycline

###Answer:",D,"A patient with recent travel history, cyclical fever, and brick red granules (Schüffner stippling) in erythrocytes suggests the diagnosis of malaria. The patient was most likely treated with chloroquine, a quinoline derivative that is a first-line agent for Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale infections. Chloroquine can cause marked QT prolongation and can cause severe ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes.

Patients on antimalarials should be monitored with an ECG regularly. The common side effect of chloroquine is gastrointestinal upset (GI), headache, blurred vision, and insomnia.

###Answer:",C,"T cells (T lymphocytes) play a central role in adaptive immunity by recognizing antigens, coordinating immune responses, and producing cytokines to activate other immune cells.",Macrophages,Dendritic cells,T cells,B cells,Natural killer cells,C,"C.  T cells

Rationale: 
T cells, particularly T helper cells (Th cells), are primarily responsible for coordinating and regulating immune responses by releasing signaling molecules called cytokines. Th cells recognize antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and respond by producing cytokines that activate other immune cells, such as B cells, macrophages, and other T cells, to mount an effective immune response. While macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells also play important roles in the immune response, they are not primarily responsible for coordinating and regulating immune responses through cytokine release. Natural killer cells are primarily involved in recognizing and eliminating infected cells or tumor cells, rather than regulating immune responses.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Glucagon
B.  epinephrine
C.  Somatostatin
D.  Insulin
E.  Progesterone

###Answer:",D,Insulin is responsible for the rise in blood glucose levels after meals.It promotes the uptake of glucose by muscles and fat cells thereby lowering blood glucose levels,Glucagon,epinephrine,Somatostatin,Insulin,Progesterone,D,"D. Insulin

Rationale: Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly by muscle and adipose tissue cells. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and the storage of glucose as glycogen. It also inhibits glucose production in the liver. In contrast, glucagon, produced by alpha cells, raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that raises blood glucose levels in response to stress. Somatostatin is a hormone produced by the delta cells of the pancreas that inhibits the secretion of other hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary that plays a role in the female reproductive cycle.",True,model6

Which of the following is the most important cause for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis?
###Options:
A.  Increased resistance to ventilation
B.  Pulmonary vasoconstriction
C.  Increased vagal stimulation of pontine centres
D.  Early fatigue of inspiratory muscles
E.  Depression of dorsal respiratory group of neurons

###Answer:",D,"The most important cause for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis is early fatigue of inspiratory muscles.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the voluntary muscles. In the context of respiratory function, weakness and fatigue of the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, can lead to inadequate ventilation. This inadequate ventilation results in impaired clearance of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to type II respiratory failure (hypercapnic respiratory failure).While other factors such as increased resistance to ventilation or depression of the dorsal respiratory group of neurons may contribute to respiratory dysfunction in certain conditions, early fatigue of inspiratory muscles is the primary mechanism responsible for type II respiratory failure in myasthenia gravis.",Increased resistance to ventilation,Pulmonary vasoconstriction,Increased vagal stimulation of pontine centres,Early fatigue of inspiratory muscles,Depression of dorsal respiratory group of neurons,D,"D. Early fatigue of inspiratory muscles

Rationale: Type II respiratory failure is characterized by a decrease in alveolar ventilation, leading to an increase in PaCO2. In myasthenia gravis, the most important cause of type II respiratory failure is early fatigue of inspiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm. This is due to the impaired transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, leading to weakness and fatigue. As a result, the patient is unable to generate sufficient inspiratory pressure to maintain adequate alveolar ventilation, leading to type II respiratory failure.",True,model6

In consideration of this patient's circumstances, what method of pregnancy termination would be both safe and efficacious at this juncture?
###Options:
A.  Suction dilation and curettage (D
B.  Dilation and evacuation (D
C.  Hypertonic saline infusion
D.  15-methyl ±-prostaglandin injectio
E.  Hysterotomy

###Answer:",A,"Surgical abortion stands as one of the safest medical procedures, boasting a minimal serious complication rate of less than 1% during the first trimester, with a mortality rate merely a fraction of that associated with term delivery. Suction dilation and curettage represent the preferred method during the initial trimester. Internationally, the combination of the oral agent RU-486 followed by prostaglandin injection has demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety, particularly within European clinical trials, proving effective up to approximately 9 weeks of gestation. Additionally, 15-methyl ±-prostaglandin serves as a viable intramuscular abortifacient, alongside options such as prostaglandin E2 suppositories or intraamniotic prostaglandin F2± for second-trimester induction of preterm labor. In light of safety concerns, intraamniotic injection of hypertonic saline is no longer deemed suitable due to its heightened risk of serious complications, including mortality, hyperosmolar crisis, cardiac failure, peritonitis, hemorrhage, and coagulation abnormalities. Thus, it is imperative to utilize superior alternatives and refrain from saline administration. Dilation and evacuation (D",Suction dilation and curettage (D,Dilation and evacuation (D,Hypertonic saline infusion,15-methyl ±-prostaglandin injectio,Hysterotomy,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is 6 weeks pregnant, which is early in the first trimester. At this stage, suction dilation and curettage (D&C) is a safe and effective method of pregnancy termination. This procedure involves dilating the cervix and using suction to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. It is a common method used in the first trimester and has a low risk of complications. The other options are not suitable for a 6-week pregnancy. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is typically used later in pregnancy, while hypertonic saline infusion, 15-methyl ±-prostaglandin injection, and hysterotomy are methods used in the second trimester or later.",True,model6

E.  (E)	It is entirely extraperitoneal

###Answer:",A,"Fallopian tubes are a conduit from the peritoneal to the uterine cavity, which can also allow sperm or bacteria from the vagina through the uterus to the peritoneal cavity. Each tube is covered by peritoneum and consists of three layers: serosa, muscularis, and mucosa. They traverse the superior portion of the broad ligament attached by a mesentery (mesosalpinx). It has four distinct areas in its 8- to 12-cm length: the portion that runs through the uterine wall (interstitial or cornual portion), the portion immediately adjacent to the uterus (isthmic portion), the midportion of the tube (ampulla), and the distal portion containing the finger-like fimbriae that sweep the ovum into the infundibu-lum of the tube. The fimbriae are intraperitoneal. The tubal lumen becomes increasingly more complex as it approaches the ovary. In tubal reanastomoses, the greatest success is attained when isthmic-isthmic or isthmic-ampullary regions can be reapproximated.

This pancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to the clinical manifestation of steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools).Therefore, the substance most likely to be decreased in this patient is:(A) BicarbonateDecreased bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts contributes to the pathophysiology of steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis.",Bicarbonate,Gastric acid,Glucagon,Insulin,Intrinsic factor,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). In CF, there is a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is a chloride channel. This leads to a decrease in chloride secretion and an increase in sodium absorption in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. As a result, there is an increase in the concentration of chloride in sweat, which is why the sweat chloride concentration is elevated in this patient. In the pancreas, the decrease in chloride secretion leads to a decrease in bicarbonate secretion, which impairs the digestion of fats and proteins, leading to steatorrhea and malabsorption.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Prolactin
B.  Oestrogen
C.  Testosterone
D.  Insulin
E.  Cortisol

###Answer:",A,Prolactin is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland and is responsible for the development of the mammary glands during pregnancy and promotes milk production after childbirth,Prolactin,Oestrogen,Testosterone,Insulin,Cortisol,A,"A
Rationale: Prolactin is the hormone primarily responsible for the development of milk ducts and milk production in pregnant and lactating females. It stimulates the growth and differentiation of mammary gland cells, leading to the formation of milk-producing alveoli. During pregnancy, prolactin levels increase, preparing the breast for lactation. After childbirth, prolactin levels surge, triggering milk production. Oestrogen, on the other hand, plays a role in the growth and differentiation of ductal tissue in the mammary gland, but it is not the primary hormone responsible for milk production.",True,model6

There was no etiology found after a diligent search. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this pregnancy?
###Options:
A.  With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient
B.  Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation
C.  Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.
D.  Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation

###Answer:",C,"A history of abruption that is unexplained confers an increased risk of abruption with subsequent pregnancies. Antenatal testing does not predict acute events such as abruption. Rather, fetal testing such as biophysical profile is designed to identify chronic uteroplacental insufficiency such as caused by chronic hypertension, renal insufficiency, or maternal lupus. Ultrasound has poor ability to identify retroplacental clots or abruption. Induction at or slightly before the time of abruption with the fetal loss, if at term, is a reasonable approach to avoid repeat abruption.","With no etiology found, the risk of abruption in this current pregnancy is the same as any other pregnant patient",Antenatal testing with biophysical profile should be considered starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation,Induction of labor should be considered at 37 to 38 weeks gestation.,Weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage should be considered starting at 32 weeks gestation,,B,"B

Rationale: 
Abruptio placentae is a serious complication of pregnancy. In the absence of an identifiable etiology, the risk of recurrence is increased. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends antenatal testing with biophysical profile starting at 34 to 35 weeks gestation in women with a history of abruptio placentae. This is to identify any potential fetal compromise and to guide timing of delivery. Induction of labor at 37 to 38 weeks gestation may be considered, but only after careful evaluation and discussion with the patient. There is no evidence to support weekly ultrasound examinations screening for retroplacental hemorrhage starting at 32 weeks gestation.",False,model6

A.  Metabolic rate will increase
B.  Rate of movement will decrease
C.  Formation of prostaglandin E2 will increase
D.  Rate of oxygen consumption will increase
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Sperm cell motility decreases as pH is reduced below 6.8. At a pH of 4.5, sperm cell motility is significantly reduced.

Rate of movement will decrease

Rationale: The normal pH of the vagina is around 4.5. Sperm cells are sensitive to pH changes. If the pH of the vagina is lowered to 4.5, the rate of movement of sperm cells will decrease. This is because sperm cells are adapted to function optimally at a pH around 7.2, which is the pH of semen. Lowering the pH of the vagina will make it difficult for sperm cells to move and fertilize the egg.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Spontaneous abortion
B.  Abruptio placenta
C.  Ovarian torsion
D.  Placenta previae
E.  Recurrent abortion

###Answer:",A,"Correct Answer
A. Spontaneous abortion
Explanation
The most likely cause of the symptoms described in the question is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage. Vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps are common signs of a miscarriage, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This occurs when the pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week. It is important for the woman to seek medical attention in order to confirm the diagnosis and receive appropriate care",Spontaneous abortion,Abruptio placenta,Ovarian torsion,Placenta previae,Recurrent abortion,A,"A

Rationale: 
Spontaneous abortion is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps in the first trimester of pregnancy. It is defined as the termination of pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation, and it occurs in up to 20% of all pregnancies. The symptoms of spontaneous abortion include vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and passage of tissue from the uterus. In this scenario, the patient is 10 weeks pregnant and is experiencing vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps, which are consistent with spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placenta is a condition that occurs later in pregnancy, typically after 20 weeks of gestation, and is characterized by vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a condition that occurs when the ovary twists, cutting off its blood supply, and is typically associated with severe abdominal pain. Placenta previae is a condition that occurs later in pregnancy, typically after 20 weeks of gestation, and is characterized by vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain. Recurrent abortion is a condition that occurs when a woman has three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions, and is not typically associated with abdominal cramps.",True,model6

He reports feeling increasingly tired and general weakness which he attributes to his poor sleep pattern. Additionally, the patient has noticed he has gained weight and sweats very easily. On examination, the patient has coarse facial features. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Hyperthyroidism
B.  Cushings disease
C.  Acromegaly
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Diabetes

###Answer:",C,"Acromegaly (C) is most commonly due to a pituitary tumour usually identified on MRI scan, patients most frequently present with changes in appearance followed by visual defects and headaches. Sleep apnoea is often a common complaint among patients due to weight gain. Other manifestations include large hands and feet, hirsutism, prominent and coarse facial features, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypertension, diabetes and heart failure among others. The glucose tolerance test is diagnostic for suspected acromegaly, GH levels can be measured directly, although elevated findings are not sufficient for diagnosis. Hyperthryoidism (A) produces symptoms that are usually secondary to an elevation in metabolic rate, such symptoms include diarrhoea, goitre, sweating and intolerance to the temperature whereby the patient consistently feels hot irrespective of the true environmental temperature. Sleep apnoea is not usually a complaint among patients since they often lose weight despite an increased appetite. Cushings disease (B) results from a pituitary tumour producing excess ACTH, the excess cortisol levels result in symptoms such as striae, bruising, thin skin, weight gain (particularly in the abdominal region) and often a dorsocervical fat pad (buffalo hump). Hypothyroidism (D) features include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. Patients do not tend to sweat more and the disease does not coarsen facial features. In diabetes (E), patients symptoms often result in weight loss though in type 2 diabetes they may suffer from sleep apnoea due to their high BMI.",Hyperthyroidism,Cushings disease,Acromegaly,Hypothyroidism,Diabetes,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of difficulty sleeping, fatigue, weight gain, and excessive sweating are consistent with acromegaly, a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone production. The coarse facial features are also a common physical finding in acromegaly. While hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and weight gain, it is less likely to cause sweating and coarse facial features. Cushing's disease can cause weight gain and fatigue, but it is typically associated with hypertension, easy bruising, and purple striae, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Hyperthyroidism can cause insomnia, weight loss, and sweating, but it is less likely to cause coarse facial features. Diabetes is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.",True,model6

This condition is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent blindness. Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis that affects the medium-sized arteries, particularly those in the head and neck region. It is common in older adults and can cause sudden vision loss due to ischemia of the optic nerve. The patient's age and the rapid progression of symptoms from one eye to the other support this diagnosis.",True,model6

A.  Leaving the placenta in situ with postoperative methotrexate.
B.  Elective caesarean hysterectomy.
C.  Removal of the placenta piecemeal and closure of bleeding points.
D.  Attempt to separate placenta and caesarean hysterectomy if bleeding occurs.
E.  Removal of the bulk of the placenta and cord and closure.

Hysterectomy should then be done to prevent excessive hemorrhage only if this fails.",Leaving the placenta in situ with postoperative methotrexate.,Elective caesarean hysterectomy.,Removal of the placenta piecemeal and closure of bleeding points.,Attempt to separate placenta and caesarean hysterectomy if bleeding occurs.,Removal of the bulk of the placenta and cord and closure.,B,"B. Elective caesarean hysterectomy.

Rationale: The patient has had 2 previous caesarean sections and is now term with an anterior low-lying placenta that fails to separate after delivery of the baby. She has also consented to a sterilisation. Given this scenario, the best option would be to perform an elective caesarean hysterectomy. This is because the risk of bleeding and other complications is high with a low-lying placenta, and the patient has already consented to a sterilisation.

He has previously undergone a splenectomy secondary to sickle cell disease. On examination, hes found to be tachycardic. Abdominal examination reveals guarding. An ultrasound scan shows gall stones in the gall bladder, free fluid in the pelvis and an appendix with a diameter of 8 mm.What is the most probable diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Sickle Cell Crisis
B.  Impacted Gall Stone
C.  Cholecystitis
D.  Acute Appendicitis
E.  Gastroenteritis

The temperature usually does not go beyond 40C. Although appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis, an ultrasound scan showing an appendix width of greater than 6mm is diagnostic.Pyrexia, guarding, and pain are all in keeping with appendicitis.Other options:- Cholecystitis is very rare in children, and although gall stones are present, there is no jaundice or biliary tree dilatation suggested by the scan.- Impacted Gall Stone: There is no mention of common bile duct dilatation in the clinical scenario.- Sickle Cell Crisis: A sickle cell crisis should not cause guarding, or an ultrasound scan finding of a dilated appendix base.- Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis would not produce the ultrasound scan findings described above with a thickened appendix.",Sickle Cell Crisis,Impacted Gall Stone,Cholecystitis,Acute Appendicitis,Gastroenteritis,D,"D. Acute Appendicitis

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including acute abdominal pain, fever, and guarding, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The ultrasound finding of an 8 mm appendix diameter supports this diagnosis. The presence of gallstones and free fluid in the pelvis may be incidental findings, but they do not explain the patient's acute symptoms. Sickle cell crisis is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an acute abdomen. Cholecystitis is also possible, but the ultrasound finding of an enlarged appendix makes acute appendicitis a more likely diagnosis. Gastroenteritis is unlikely given the patient's guarding and ultrasound findings.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"C. Frequent vaginal examination to assess cervical dilation - False. Frequent vaginal examinations increase the risk of introducing pathogens into the uterus and should be minimized to reduce the risk of ascending infection. Therefore, frequent vaginal examinations are not typically part of conservative management for PROM.",Serial CBC to diagnose rising WBC.,Closed monitoring of maternal vital signs.,Frequent vaginal examination to asses cervical dilation.,US to asses fetal weight and the amount of liquor.,Monitoring of fetus by doing cardiogram,C,"C

Rationale: In cases of premature rupture of membranes, conservative management is often adopted. In this approach, the patient is closely monitored for any signs of infection or fetal distress. The following are acceptable practices in conservative management:

* Serial CBC to diagnose rising WBC counts, which may indicate infection (Option A).
* Closed monitoring of maternal vital signs to detect any signs of infection or other complications (Option B).
* US to assess fetal weight and the amount of liquor, which helps in monitoring fetal growth and well-being (Option D).
* Monitoring of fetus by doing cardiogram to detect any signs of fetal distress (Option E).

However, frequent vaginal examination to assess cervical dilation is not recommended in conservative management of premature rupture of membranes. This is because frequent vaginal examinations can increase the risk of infection. Instead, a sterile speculum examination may be performed to assess the cervix (Option C).",True,model6

E.  appendicitis

###Answer:",A,"Pelvic inflammatory disease is classically described as lower abdominal pain that is gradual in onset and bilateral. Fever, vaginal discharge, dysuria, and occasionally abnormal vaginal bleeding may be associated symptoms. The minimal diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness. Treatment should provide coverage for likely etiologic agents (N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, anaerobes, and enteric gram-negative rods).",Pelvic inflammatory disease,ectopic pregnancy,ovarian cyst,uterine leiyomyoma,appendicitis,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of bilateral pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge, and tenderness on pelvic examination are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, typically caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The patient's symptoms, particularly the cervical motion tenderness, are consistent with this diagnosis. While ectopic pregnancy (Option B) may also cause pelvic pain, the patient's symptoms do not suggest an acute abdomen or peritoneal signs, which are more typical of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cyst (Option C) would not typically cause fever, vaginal discharge, or cervical motion tenderness. Uterine leiomyoma (Option D) is a benign tumor that would not cause these symptoms.

Rationale:
Endometrial hyperplasia is more likely to occur in obese patients because they have higher levels of estrogen due to peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue. This leads to increased proliferation of the endometrium, resulting in hyperplasia. In this case, the patient is more likely to have endometrial hyperplasia if she is obese, making the endometrial biopsy more likely to show important pathology.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient has a history of cough, fatigue, and weight loss, which are symptoms of tuberculosis (TB). The positive PPD skin test with an induration of 10 mm is also suggestive of TB. However, a positive PPD test does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of TB. To further evaluate the patient, a chest radiograph should be obtained to look for signs of active TB, such as infiltrates, cavities, or lymphadenopathy. The chest radiograph will help guide further management, including the decision to initiate TB therapy. An interferon-gamma release assay (Option A) may be useful in certain situations, but it is not the next step in this patient's management. Repeating the PPD skin test (Option B) is unnecessary, as the patient already has a positive result.

###Options:
A.  A low serum C-reactive protein level
B.  Normal serum albumin level
C.  Circumferential ulcers with caseating granulomas
D.  Anemia
E.  None

###Answer:",C,"This patient has gastrointestinal tuberculosis (GI TB) based on his country of origin, positive PCR on the sputum sample, and chest imaging findings. TB of the Gl tract appears as circumferential ulcers surrounded by inflamed mucosa, with caseating granulomas. Crohn disease presents with longitudinal ulcers with skip lesions and cobblestone appearance.

The ileocecal region is the most commonly involved site of GI TB due to the abundance of lymphoid tissue, relative stasis, and minimal digestive activity.

Antituberculous therapy is the mainstay of treatment for GI TB. Establishing the diagnosis of GI TB is often difficult, and treatment can be initiated with a presumptive diagnosis of TB enteritis in the setting of active pulmonary TB together with clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic features of intestinal TB.

Although anemia could be a common presentation with GI TB, it can also be seen in patients with Crohn disease with recurrent bleeding.",A low serum C-reactive protein level,Normal serum albumin level,Circumferential ulcers with caseating granulomas,Anemia,,C,"C

Rationale: 
This patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of a solitary calcification in the right upper lobe on chest x-ray and a positive polymerase chain reaction assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an induced sputum sample suggests that the patient has tuberculosis (TB). The differential diagnosis is between Crohn disease and intestinal TB.

###Options:
A.  Protect the brain
B.  Improve sleep
C.  Maintain the blood-brain barrier
D.  Slow neurotransmission
E.  fast neurotransmission

###Answer:",A,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides a buoyant force to support the brain. The brain has a mass of approximately 1400 g while at the same time being relatively malleable. However, since the CSF surrounds the brain, it dissipates much of the downward force that would normally act on the organ.

CSF is thought to play a role in brain thermoregulation and general homeostasis. It also provides the primary buoyant force that keeps the brain afloat within the skull.

The brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid, which helps decrease the damage that the brain's weight could cause. Cerebrospinal fluid also helps remove waste products around the brain.

CSF has physical properties as a fluid that protects the brain from damage caused by sudden movements of the skull. Any rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head has the potential to injure the delicate contents that are contained within.",Protect the brain,Improve sleep,Maintain the blood-brain barrier,Slow neurotransmission,fast neurotransmission,A,"A.  Protect the brain

Rationale: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It plays a crucial role in protecting the brain by acting as a shock absorber, reducing the mechanical stress on the brain and spinal cord. It also helps to remove waste products from the central nervous system, regulate the pressure within the skull, and provide buoyancy to the brain. In this scenario, the patient has a skull base fracture, which has led to the leakage of CSF from the nostrils.

Rationale: Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and postural instability. The other options do not match this specific set of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by demyelination and lesions in the central nervous system, leading to a wide range of symptoms. ALS is a motor neuron disease characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.

She is apyrexial and has a C-reactive protein (CRP) <5. You suspect an abnormality of the patients iron stores. What is the most appropriate investigation to determine iron store levels?
###Options:
A.  Bone marrow biopsy
B.  Serum ferritin
C.  Serum transferrin
D.  Total iron binding capacity
E.  Serum iron

###Answer:",B,"Iron deficiency can be an important cause of anaemia in patients. In this case vitamin B12 and folic acid are less likely to be important given the patients diet, however tea is alkaline and reduces the bodys ability to effectively absorb iron. Measuring the patients serum ferritin (B) provides an accurate reflection of the bodys iron stores since the serum ferritin 208 Section 7: Haematology originates from the storage pools in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. Be aware that ferritin measurements are only accurate when CRP is normal since both ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants. The serum transferrin (C) level reflects the levels of protein that bind to iron and transports it around the body and is usually 33 per cent saturated, hence not providing the most accurate level of iron. The serum iron level (E) is a poor reflection of iron stores since this can change dependent on disease states. In iron deficiency anaemia, the serum iron and iron stores are low, however in anaemia of chronic disease iron stores are increased yet the serum iron level is reduced. The total iron binding capacity (D) specifically saturates transferrin in order to measure the iron-carrying capacity in the body rather than iron stores and so would not be appropriate here. A bone marrow biopsy (A) is a very sensitive test since iron staining reflects iron stores in macrophages. However, it is both expensive and invasive and therefore not the most appropriate test compared to serum ferritin.",Bone marrow biopsy,Serum ferritin,Serum transferrin,Total iron binding capacity,Serum iron,B,"B. Serum ferritin

Rationale: Serum ferritin is the most appropriate investigation to determine iron store levels. It is a protein that stores and releases iron as needed. The level of ferritin in the blood correlates with the amount of iron stored in the body. Low levels of ferritin indicate iron deficiency, while high levels indicate iron overload. In this scenario, the patient's recent adoption of a vegetarian diet and consumption of tea, which can inhibit iron absorption, increase the likelihood of iron deficiency.",True,model6

Adding an aldosterone antagonist, such as spironolactone, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in this patient population. A phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and nitrate may improve symptoms, but they do not have the same proven benefit on outcomes as an aldosterone antagonist.

Rationale: 
The patient is presenting with worsening heart failure symptoms, and her current regimen includes an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and a diuretic. According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, the next step in management would be to add an aldosterone antagonist (such as spironolactone) to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure.

She has felt more irritable although this is often transient. On examination, a diffuse swelling is palpated with no bruit on auscultation. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Hyperthyroidism
B.  Simple goitre
C.  Riedels thyroiditis
D.  Thyroid carcinoma
E.  Thyroid cyst

###Answer:",B,"A simple goitre (B) is an idiopathic enlargement of the thyroid. Often the condition is associated with thyroid antibodies, but these do not cause any symptoms. Riedels thyroiditis (C) is a rare inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland that is characterized by fibrosis of the thyroid gland and other structures in the neck. It is often stony or woody on palpation and patients are usually asymptomatic. The patient does not have any features of hyperthyroidism (A) in which a thyroid bruit can be present. A thyroid cyst or nodule (E) is usually harmless and is a fluid-filled swelling often presenting as a single compressible small lump rather than a diffuse swelling. A full history and examination should always be conducted with ultrasound and fine needle examination to exclude malignancy. Thyroid cancer (D) is a rare but important diagnosis, they often present as irregular thyroid nodules but can metastasize to the lung, brain, liver and bone. Papillary and follicular cancers usually have good prognoses compared to medullary and anaplastic cancers.",Hyperthyroidism,Simple goitre,Riedels thyroiditis,Thyroid carcinoma,Thyroid cyst,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a simple goitre, which is a benign enlargement of the thyroid gland. The diffuse swelling, lack of bruit, and the patient's age are all indicative of this diagnosis. The patient's irritability is likely related to the goitre rather than hyperthyroidism, which would typically present with more pronounced symptoms such as weight loss, tremors, and heat intolerance. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare condition that presents with a hard, woody thyroid gland, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Thyroid carcinoma is possible but less likely given the patient's age and the lack of other symptoms.

###Answer:",B,Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality in African countries with limited access to emergency obstetric care and skilled birth attendants.,Eclampsia,Postpartum hemorrhage,Placental abruption,Puerperal sepsis,Obstetric fistula,B,"B

Rationale: 
Maternal mortality is a significant problem in many African countries, particularly in those with limited access to emergency obstetric care. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality globally, accounting for approximately 25% of maternal deaths. In African countries with limited access to emergency obstetric care, PPH is often the most common cause of maternal mortality, as it can occur suddenly and be difficult to treat without prompt access to medical care. While eclampsia, placental abruption, and puerperal sepsis are all significant causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, PPH is the most common cause of maternal mortality in these settings. Obstetric fistula, while a significant problem in some African countries, is not typically a direct cause of maternal mortality.",True,model6

The patient has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with oral medications, a 20-pack-year smoking history, and hypertension. The patient has not had an eye examination in over 5 years but was told at that time that he had some early changes in his eyes due to diabetes.

C.  Change in size of uterus in pregnancy
D.  Hormonal changes during menopause
E.  All of the above

###Answer:",E,"All the statements provided are possible risk factors for development of UTIs in women.Poor hygiene during menses can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract. The anatomy of the urinary system in women is such that the urethra is shorter as compared to men, thus making it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and cause infections.During pregnancy, the uterus expands and pits pressure on the bladder and urinary tract making it hard to completely empty the bladder thus causing urinary stasis that increases risk of UTIs. Hormonal changes in menopause can lead to changes in the urinary tract, including thinning of vaginal walls and decreased levels of estrogen which increases the risk of UTIs.",Poor hygiene practices during the periods,The anatomy of the urinary system of women,Change in size of uterus in pregnancy,Hormonal changes during menopause,All of the above,E,"E. All of the above

Rationale: Women are more prone to developing urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to various risk factors. These include:

1. **Anatomy of the urinary system**: The shorter urethra in women (about 4 cm) compared to men (about 20 cm) makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and cause infection.

2. **Poor hygiene practices during periods**: Not changing sanitary napkins or tampons frequently, or wiping from back to front after using the toilet can push bacteria from the rectum into the urethra.

3. **Hormonal changes during menopause**: Decreased estrogen levels can lead to changes in the urinary tract, making it more susceptible to infection.

4. **Pregnancy**: The growing uterus can put pressure on the bladder and ureters, increasing the risk of UTIs. Additionally, hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect the urinary tract and increase the risk of infection.

C.  The right ventricle is assisted by the respiratory pump
D.  The resistance of the systemic circulation is greater than that of the pulmonary circulation.
E.  All of the above

###Answer:",D,The length of the blood vessels that make up the systemic circuit is much greater than the length of vessels in the pulmonary circulation. This greater length presents a greater resistance to the flow of blood. So the LV must be stronger  made of thicker muscle  to exert sufficient pressure on the blood to overcome the resistance.,The left ventricle has to pump blood to the brain against gravity.,The left ventricle has to pump a greater volume of blood than the right ventricle.,The right ventricle is assisted by the respiratory pump,The resistance of the systemic circulation is greater than that of the pulmonary circulation.,All of the above,D,"D. The resistance of the systemic circulation is greater than that of the pulmonary circulation.

Rationale: The main reason why the myocardium of the left ventricle is thicker than that of the right ventricle is because the left ventricle has to pump blood against a higher resistance in the systemic circulation compared to the pulmonary circulation. The systemic circulation has a higher blood pressure and resistance due to the longer distance and smaller diameter of the blood vessels, which requires the left ventricle to generate more force to pump blood effectively. This increased workload leads to the development of a thicker myocardium in the left ventricle.",True,model6

###Answer:",E,"Given the patient's presentation with low blood pressure and evidence of cardiogenic shock, the most appropriate drug to administer to increase blood pressure without further increasing the pulse rate is:(E) Phenylephrine",Dopamine,Epinephrine,Isoproterenol,Norepinephrine,Phenylephrine,E,"E. Phenylephrine

Rationale: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to an acute myocardial infarction. The physician wants to increase the patient's blood pressure without increasing her heart rate. Phenylephrine is an alpha-agonist that increases peripheral vascular resistance, thereby increasing blood pressure, without affecting heart rate. It is the best choice in this scenario. Dopamine and norepinephrine can increase blood pressure but also have beta-adrenergic effects that can increase heart rate. Epinephrine and isoproterenol are beta-agonists that can increase heart rate and are not suitable for this patient.",True,model6

Blood cultures are most likely to grow which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Fungi
B.  Bartonella
C.  Diptheroid
D.  Staphlococcus epidermidis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis, particularly in the early postoperative period. However, in this case, where the valve was replaced 5 years ago, S. epidermidis is still a common cause. The other options are less likely. Fungi are a rare cause of endocarditis and usually occur in the setting of immunosuppression or intravenous drug use. Bartonella is a rare cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Diptheroid is a contaminant and not a common cause of endocarditis. Streptococcus bovis is a cause of endocarditis, but it is more commonly associated with colonic pathology and is not as commonly associated with prosthetic valves as S. epidermidis.",True,model6

B.  ALT is increased two  to sevenfold, >400 IU/L
C.  AST / ALT is usually >1
D.  Bilirubin is increased associated with marked elevation in alkaline phosphatase
E.  AST / ALT is usually <1

###Answer:",C,"In the laboratory diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis, the AST (aspartate aminotransferase) to ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ratio is usually greater than 1. This means that the AST levels are higher than the ALT levels. This is a characteristic finding in these conditions and can help differentiate them from other liver diseases. The increased AST levels suggest liver damage, while the increased ALT levels indicate ongoing inflammation. Therefore, a higher AST/ALT ratio is indicative of alcoholic liver disease.","AST is increased two to sevenfold, >400 IU/L, greater than ALT","ALT is increased two  to sevenfold, >400 IU/L",AST / ALT is usually >1,Bilirubin is increased associated with marked elevation in alkaline phosphatase,AST / ALT is usually <1,C,"C

Rationale: In the laboratory diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis, AST is increased two to sevenfold, usually <400 IU/L, and AST/ALT is usually >1. This is because alcohol specifically inhibits the synthesis of ALT in the liver. Therefore, the AST/ALT ratio is often >1 in alcohol-induced liver disease.",True,model6

On physical examination, she has moderate exophthalmos and tremors of the outstretched hands bilaterally. What is the cause of this patient's findings?
###Options:
A.  Ectopic production of thyroid-stimulating hormone
B.  Increased TSH production by the pituitary gland
C.  Autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor
D.  Surreptitious intake of thyroid hormones
E.  Increased estrogen

###Answer:",C,"This patient's exophthalmos is suggestive of Graves' disease. Other features seen in this patient are also seen in other causes of hyperthyroidism.

Graves disease is caused by antibodies against the thyrotropin receptor, which stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones regardless of the level of these hormones in the blood. Exophthalmos is caused by lymphocytic infiltration, enlargement of extraocular muscles, and fibroblast proliferation.

High levels of thyroid hormones in the blood suppress the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland, so TSH levels are low in this patient.

Ectopic production of TSH may be seen in some malignancies. Increased TSH production by the pituitary is seen in cases of pituitary adenoma. Exophthalmos is not seen in these cases.",Ectopic production of thyroid-stimulating hormone,Increased TSH production by the pituitary gland,Autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor,Surreptitious intake of thyroid hormones,Increased estrogen,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of mood swings, palpitations, and excessive sweating suggest hyperthyroidism. The physical examination findings of moderate exophthalmos and tremors of the outstretched hands bilaterally are consistent with Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor.

###Answer:",A,"This patient has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to placental abruption.

Fresh frozen plasma is indicated for the deficiency of coagulation factors with abnormal coagulation tests in the presence of active bleeding.

Fresh frozen plasma is the fluid portion of a unit of whole blood frozen in a designated time frame, usually within 8 hours.

The patient does not need a platelet transfusion, as a common threshold utilized for platelet transfusions in this patient population is less than 50,000 cells/microL for actively hemorrhaging patients and 10,000 to 20,000 cells/microL for those not actively bleeding but at high risk of future bleeding.",Fresh frozen plasma,whole blood,platelet concentrate,Packed red blood cells,serum,A,"A.

###Options:
A.  Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin
B.  Reduced copper excretion
C.  Iron overload
D.  Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease
E.  copper overload

###Answer:",A,"Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism. The pathogenesis is thought to be secondary to either reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase (UG1A1) or reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the liver. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and excreted in bile.

In addition to reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with UG1A1, reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin in the liver may also be important in a subset of patients.

Triggers can precipitate the development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Gilbert syndrome. Potential triggers include stress, overexertion, fasting, intercurrent illness, menstruation, and dehydration. Patients with Gilbert syndrome exhibit mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels. Typically, there is no evidence of other disorders to explain the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert syndrome does not require treatment. When confronted with patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the healthcare provider needs to consider other causes, including but not limited to hemolytic reactions, resorbing hematomas, dyserythropoiesis, Wilson disease, and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Patients with hemolysis will exhibit an elevated reticulocyte count, high LDH, and low haptoglobin. Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism that will typically show other manifestations on physical and laboratory examinations not seen in this patient. Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome present with much higher unconjugated bilirubin levels. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload and typically shows physical or laboratory abnormalities not seen in this patient. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis are autoimmune liver diseases and will present differently than shown in this patient.",Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin,Reduced copper excretion,Iron overload,Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease,copper overload,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory values are consistent with Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition characterized by mild, intermittent jaundice. The pathogenesis of Gilbert's syndrome is a deficiency in the enzyme UDP-glucuronyltransferase, which is necessary for the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. As a result, there is reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin, leading to increased levels in the bloodstream. This condition is typically asymptomatic and is often discovered incidentally on routine laboratory testing.",True,model6

This syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic nerve fibers that originate in the thoracic spine and ascend through the brachial plexus to innervate the face. In this case, the injury is likely to the right brachial plexus, which would result in Horner syndrome on the right side of the face.",True,model6

She is treated with cornstarch and vitamin supplementation and abstains from foods containing sucrose, fructose, and galactose. If this regimen is not followed, severe fasting hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia will ensue. Which function is associated with the defective enzyme in this infant?
###Options:
A.  Glucose 6- phosphate hydrolysis in muscle cells

###Answer:",B,"This infant suffers from type 1 glycogen storage disease, caused by a lack of glucose-6 phosphatase, resulting in severe fasting hypoglycemia.

Glucose-6 phosphatase catalyzes a common pathway in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6 phosphate into glucose.

This enzyme is expressed primarily in the liver, kidneys, and intestinal epithelium. Muscle cells do not express the enzyme because the glucose they produce by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis is for muscle energy needs.

Pyruvate carboxylation in hepatic cells is a major step in gluconeogenesis, and it is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase.",Glucose 6- phosphate hydrolysis in muscle cells,Renal cell glycogenolysis,Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) phosphorylation in muscle cells,Pyruvate decarboxylation in hepatic cells,Renal cell gluconeogenesis,E,"E. Renal cell gluconeogenesis

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question are characteristic of Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI), which is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the liver, kidney, and small intestine. The treatment described, which involves avoiding sucrose, fructose, and galactose, is consistent with HFI. The symptoms of HFI are due to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia.

She is currently being treated with furosemide and supplemental oxygen as needed. She was previously treated with oral corticosteroids for her ILD. CT scan of the chest is performed and shows an extensive honey-combing pattern in both lungs. As her shortness of breath and cough do not significantly improve with aggressive diuretic therapy, the decision is made to start IV methylprednisolone to decrease lung parenchyma inflammation. The next day, the patient is found to be anxious, restless, and reports seeing animals roam around her room. What is the most likely cause of this patient's visual hallucinations?
###Options:
A.  Delirium tremens
B.  Schizophrenia
C.  Delirium
D.  Steroid-induced psychosis
E.  Mania

###Answer:",D,"Most of the toxic effects of methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids are predictable from their impact on the body's physiology. Some are life-threatening and include metabolic effects (growth inhibition, diabetes, muscle wasting, osteoporosis), salt retention (although less common with methylprednisolone), and psychosis.

Glucocorticoids, depending on the dose and duration of therapy, can cause a range of neuropsychiatric complications. This patient was under chronic glucocorticoid treatment for her underlying interstitial lung disease, and the drug was discontinued upon admission to the hospital. The administration of methylprednisolone likely served as a trigger for her neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The slow tapering of the offending drug is advised.

Methylprednisolone and its derivatives, methylprednisolone acetate succinate, and methylprednisolone sodium, are intermediate-acting, synthetic glucocorticoids used mainly as anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agents.

Steroid-induced psychosis

Rationale: The patient is experiencing visual hallucinations, which are a common symptom of steroid-induced psychosis. The patient was recently started on IV methylprednisolone to decrease lung parenchyma inflammation, which is a strong risk factor for developing steroid-induced psychosis. This is especially true in older adults, as they are more susceptible to the neuropsychiatric effects of corticosteroids.

Oxygen should be given at 100%. It works if given within an hour after the headache starts. Medical personnel often have difficulty obtaining insurance approval for at-home oxygen for cluster headaches and must have other options available.

Triptans are considered first-line treatments for aborting cluster headaches. However, the time of onset in oral triptans is considered unacceptable for therapy. Cluster headaches can last as short as 15 minutes and thus require a faster onset, such as subcutaneously or intranasally delivered.

Ibuprofen is not recommended in the treatment of a cluster headache patient. Intranasal lidocaine is also often used for treatment, though it is not as effective. Verapamil is used as preventive therapy.",Subcutaneous triptan,Ibuprofen,Verapamil,Intranasal lidocaine,Propanolol,D,"D. Intranasal lidocaine

Rationale: The symptoms described are consistent with cluster headaches. The patient's history of responding to oxygen therapy also supports this diagnosis. Intranasal lidocaine is an effective abortive treatment for cluster headaches, providing rapid relief from symptoms. It is applied to the nostril on the same side as the headache.

A.  Increase daily metformin dosage
B.  Discontinue combination oral contraceptive pills
C.  Weight Loss
D.  Smoking cessation
E.  Healthy eating

###Answer:",C,"The relative risk of endometrial cancer is 2.5 times higher in women with a BMI of >30 kg/m2 compared with those of normal weight. For this reason, individuals with an elevated BMI will reduce their risk of endometrial cancer with healthy weight loss. Weight loss of e5% of body weight results in a 30% lower risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women.

Women who are obese have a high risk of endometrial cancer because fatty tissues convert androstenedione to estrogen. Unopposed estrogen exposure is the leading risk factor for developing endometrial cancer.

In the vignette, the patient has a clinical presentation consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with chronic anovulation, another cause of unopposed estrogen. Additionally, decreased physical activity and high fat and glycemic index diets have been associated with an increased endometrial cancer risk. Women with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are estimated to have 2 times the risk of endometrial cancer. 

Higher parity, smoking, and the use of oral contraceptives decrease overall estrogen exposure and, therefore, the risk of endometrial cancer.",Increase daily metformin dosage,Discontinue combination oral contraceptive pills,Weight Loss,Smoking cessation,Healthy eating,C,"C.  Weight Loss

Rationale: The patient has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as evident from her symptoms of facial hair, irregular periods, and the ultrasound findings. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Weight loss is the most effective way to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer in this patient. Women with PCOS are often insulin-resistant and obese, which contributes to their increased risk of endometrial cancer. Weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgen levels, and regulate menstrual cycles, thereby reducing the risk of endometrial cancer. While metformin may also have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity and menstrual regulation, increasing the dosage is not the most effective way to reduce endometrial cancer risk. Discontinuing the oral contraceptive pill would likely worsen the patient's symptoms and increase her risk of endometrial cancer. Smoking cessation and healthy eating are important for overall health but are not as directly related to reducing endometrial cancer risk in this patient.",True,model6

Affected individuals often hold their arm in an internally rotated, extended position, with forearm pronation, which is commonly referred to as the ""waiter's tip"" position.",C8-T1,C6-C7,C5-C6,C4-C5,C7-C8,B,"B. C6-C7

Rationale: Erb-Duchenne paralysis is a type of brachial plexus injury that occurs due to a traumatic injury during delivery. It is characterized by a paralysis of the upper arm, specifically the deltoid, biceps, and brachialis muscles. This is due to an injury to the C6-C7 nerve roots, which are responsible for innervating these muscles. The injury typically occurs when the baby's head is pulled away from the shoulder during delivery, causing a stretch or tear of the brachial plexus. In this case, the large infant and difficult delivery likely contributed to the development of the Erb-Duchenne paralysis.",False,model6

An anatomic cause of the magnitude of her flow has been ruled out. Which of the following has been shown to be most effective in reducing rather than eliminating her menstrual flow?
###Options:
A.  Tranexamic acid
B.  Dilation and curettage
C.  Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)
D.  Misoprostol
E.  Ergonovine maleate

###Answer:",A,"Tranexamic acid has been shown to be most effective in reducing, rather than eliminating, menstrual flow. This medication works by preventing the breakdown of blood clots, which can help to decrease the amount of blood loss during menstruation. It is often used as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding and has been found to be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in many patients. Dilation and curettage, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), misoprostol, and ergonovine maleate are not specifically indicated for reducing menstrual flow.",Tranexamic acid,Dilation and curettage,Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),Misoprostol,Ergonovine maleate,A,"A

Rationale: Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual blood loss by up to 50%. It works by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which is responsible for breaking down blood clots. Tranexamic acid is often used to treat menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) when anatomic causes have been ruled out. It is usually taken orally, 1-2 grams three times a day, for 3-5 days during menstruation.",True,model6

C.  Increase in vital capacity
D.  Decrease in total lung capacity
E.  Increase in minute ventilation

###Answer:",A,"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially emphysema due to smoking, the main physiological defect observed on pulmonary function test is an increase in the residual volume. This is due to loss of elastic recoil and airway collapse during expiration preventing the air from being expelled leading to increased trapping of air.",Increase in residual volume,Decrease in tidal volume,Increase in vital capacity,Decrease in total lung capacity,Increase in minute ventilation,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD, the primary physiological defect is airflow obstruction, which is typically measured by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and an increase in the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC). This is due to the destruction of lung tissue, particularly in the peripheral airspaces, leading to a loss of elastic recoil and an increase in lung volume. Therefore, the most likely finding on pulmonary function testing would be an increase in residual volume.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient is a full-term, 3-hour-old boy who has vomited twice after feeding, with green emesis. The presence of air in the duodenum and stomach on x-ray suggests a diagnosis of malrotation with volvulus. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of polyhydramnios during pregnancy, which is a common association with intestinal malrotation. The patient's symptoms and x-ray findings are not consistent with pyloric stenosis, which typically presents with non-bilious vomiting later in life. Duodenal atresia would typically present with a ""double bubble"" sign on x-ray, which is not mentioned in this scenario.

Rationale: 
The level of beta HCG is an indicator of the health and viability of the pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy, the beta HCG levels should double every 48 hours. A significant fall in the level of beta HCG indicates a non-viable pregnancy, which could be a missed miscarriage.

However, most ACE inhibitors undergo hepatic conversion to active metabolites, so his hepatic impairment is of concern. Because lisinopril is one of the two ACE inhibitors that does not undergo hepatic conversion to active metabolites, it is the best choice.

Rationale: In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors are preferred for the treatment of hypertension. Lisinopril is a suitable option for this patient. Thiazide diuretics are also a good choice in patients with diabetes and hypertension. However, in patients with liver impairment, thiazides may worsen the liver function, so close monitoring is required. Spironolactone is not a good option as it is contraindicated in liver disease. Fosinopril is also an ACE inhibitor, but it is not a better option than lisinopril. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and is not a good choice in this patient.

###Answer:",D,"This woman presents with upper (brisk reflexes, upgoing plantar) and lower (fasciculations) motor neurone signs. Motor neurone disease (MND) (D) presents with mixed upper and lower motor neurone signs and importantly no sensory involvement. In this case, there is involvement of two regions (arms and legs). Bulbar signs, such as tongue wasting and fasciculation, often help make the diagnosis. Myositis (C) affects the muscle, resulting in tenderness, wasting and fasciculation but no upper motor neurone (UMN) signs. Although the patient is diabetic, neuropathies (B) result in lower motor neurone (LMN) signs only. These may be motor and/or sensory. Typically, diabetes results in a peripheral neuropathy, most commonly sensory. The proximal distribution of weakness would be in keeping with myasthenia (A), but not the UMN signs. There is no mention of fatigability, which is a key feature.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND), specifically amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs, such as muscle weakness, wasting, fasciculations, and brisk reflexes, is consistent with this diagnosis. The positive Hoffman's and Babinski's signs indicate upper motor neuron involvement. The normal sensory examination and cranial nerves further support this diagnosis. Myasthenia gravis would typically present with fluctuating weakness and fatigability, whereas myositis would present with muscle pain and inflammation. Diabetic neuropathy would typically affect the distal extremities and would not explain the upper motor neuron signs.

###Options:
A.  Poor dentition
B.  Recent tooth extraction
C.  Treatment of diabetes with glipizide
D.  Treatment of bony metastases with denosumab
E.  old age

###Answer:",C,"Glipizide is a sulfonylurea. Its mechanism of action is to bind and thus inhibit K-ATP channels, leading to increased insulin secretion. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is not a known side effect of glipizide.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a known but rare side effect of denosumab. Symptoms may include jaw pain, tooth infection, bone, gingival erosion, and toothache. Denosumab should not be initiated until dental health is optimized.

Predisposing factors for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw include poor dentition, recent dental surgery/tooth extraction, osteoclast inhibitor therapy (denosumab, bisphosphonates), and/or concurrent antineoplastic therapy. An increased risk of being diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw correlates directly to the duration of denosumab exposure.

The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw is considerably higher in patients with malignancy receiving denosumab than in patients with osteoporosis receiving denosumab. Dental procedures are contraindicated while on denosumab for cancer therapy.",Poor dentition,Recent tooth extraction,Treatment of diabetes with glipizide,Treatment of bony metastases with denosumab,old age,C,"C.

Rationale: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of ovarian follicles in females. FSH stimulates the growth and differentiation of follicles, leading to the production of estrogen and the development of a dominant follicle that will eventually release an egg during ovulation. Estrogen and progesterone are sex steroids produced by the ovaries, whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) is another pituitary hormone that surges just before ovulation, triggering the release of the egg. Prolactin is a hormone involved in lactation, but it is not directly involved in ovarian follicle development.",True,model6

She has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Breast development began at the age of 10 years. She has never been sexually active. She is at the 90th percentile for height, 75th percentile for weight, and 69th percentile for BMI. Sexual maturity rating is 4 for breast development. Pelvic examination shows a normal-appearing vagina; the cervix and uterus cannot be palpated. Her serum testosterone concentration is 340 ng/dL (N=540). Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, 17±-hydroxyprogesterone, and prolactin are within the reference ranges. Serum ²-hCG testing is negative. Pelvic ultrasonography shows no uterus. Her karyotype is 46,XY. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Estrogen and progestin therapy
B.  Gonadectomy
C.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy
D.  Progestin therapy only
E.  No further management is indicated

###Answer:",B,"Given the presence of breast development, high serum testosterone levels, absence of a uterus on pelvic ultrasound, and a karyotype of 46,XY, the most appropriate next step in management is (B) Gonadectomy. This presentation is consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), where the individual has XY chromosomes but is insensitive to androgens, resulting in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics without the presence of a uterus or fallopian tubes. Gonadectomy is recommended to prevent the risk of gonadal malignancy and to align with the patient's female gender identity.",Estrogen and progestin therapy,Gonadectomy,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy,Progestin therapy only,No further management is indicated,B,"B

Rationale: The patient has a condition known as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is a type of 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD). AIS is characterized by a normal 46,XY karyotype, normal to high levels of testosterone, and varying degrees of androgen insensitivity, leading to undervirilization or feminization. In this case, the patient has a complete form of AIS, with a normal female phenotype but no uterus or ovaries. The presence of high levels of testosterone and the absence of a uterus and ovaries suggest that the gonads are testes, which are producing androgens. The next step in management is gonadectomy (removal of the testes) to prevent future malignancy, as the risk of germ cell tumors is increased in individuals with AIS. Estrogen and progestin therapy may be necessary later to maintain feminization, but gonadectomy is the initial priority.",True,model6

Rationale: 
The patient has acute pericarditis secondary to a probable viral myocarditis. Ibuprofen was prescribed initially, but the symptoms persisted after a week. Colchicine is a good option in this scenario as it has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and preventing recurrences of acute pericarditis. It is typically used in combination with NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Pericardial stripping (A) is a surgical procedure that is usually reserved for patients with constrictive pericarditis, which is not the case here. Prednisone (B) is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat pericarditis, but it should be used with caution as it can lead to rebound pericarditis when tapered. Continuing ibuprofen (C) alone may not be sufficient to control the symptoms, and adding colchicine can provide additional benefit.",True,model6

Substances such as gasoline, kerosene, and furniture polish, which contain hydrocarbons, are frequently implicated in cases of hydrocarbon aspiration. This condition can lead to dyspnea, cyanosis, and respiratory failure. Treatment typically involves addressing symptoms, which may necessitate intubation and mechanical ventilation. It's important to note that inducing emesis is not recommended, as it could lead to further aspiration. Placement of a nasogastric tube is reserved for instances of high-volume ingestions or when the hydrocarbon is mixed with another toxic substance.

Rationale: The scenario suggests that the child may have ingested gasoline while playing in the garage, possibly due to the proximity of the weed-whacker and the gasoline smell. The symptoms described, such as gagging, vomiting, cough, rapid breathing, and subcostal retractions, are indicative of hydrocarbon aspiration. The most suitable initial course of action would be to assess the child's respiratory status by performing pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis to evaluate for potential respiratory acidosis or hypoxia.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan indicates a small, well-circumscribed rounded mass lying within the cerebellopontine angle. The mass originates from the internal auditory canal and is found to have no connection with the cerebellum or brainstem. Based on these imaging results, what is the probable diagnosis of the patient?
###Options:
A.  Acoustic neuroma
B.  Meningioma
C.  Glioma
D.  Pituitary adenoma
E.  Medulloblastoma

###Answer:",A,"An acoustic neuroma, also known as vestibular schwannoma, is a benign primary intracranial tumor of the myelin-forming cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (8th cranial nerve). The typical location is the cerebellopontine angle and it often originates from the internal auditory canal, fitting perfectly with the imaging results described in the question.",Acoustic neuroma,Meningioma,Glioma,Pituitary adenoma,Medulloblastoma,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and the MRI findings are consistent with an acoustic neuroma. The cerebellopontine angle is a common location for this type of tumor, which originates from the internal auditory canal and grows outward. The tumor's well-circumscribed, rounded shape and lack of connection with the cerebellum or brainstem further support this diagnosis. Acoustic neuromas are benign, slow-growing tumors that arise from the Schwann cells of the vestibular nerve. They can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems, but headaches are a less common symptom.",True,model6

She has a history of hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and hyperlipidemia. She continues to have elevated blood pressure despite being on lisinopril, carvedilol, torsemide, and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate. Her other medications are aspirin and atorvastatin. Today, her blood pressure is 151/92 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 78 bpm. Her physical exam is normal except for some trace lower extremity edema. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
###Options:
A.  Spironolactone
B.  Chlorthalidone

Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist indicated in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Spironolactone is proven to decrease mortality in patients with systolic dysfunction.

Adding a thiazide-type diuretic is not the best next step in treating this patient with systolic dysfunction. Angiotensin receptor blockers are indicated to manage congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, they are not recommended to be combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This patient is already on lisinopril, which is not advised to be combined with losartan.

This class of medications is contraindicated in patients with reduced ejection fraction.",Spironolactone,Chlorthalidone,Losartan,Diltiazem,,B,"B

Rationale: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite being on multiple medications. The next step in management would be to add a diuretic, specifically a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone, which has been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with heart failure. Spironolactone is already implied by the presence of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, which is often used in combination with spironolactone. Losartan would be a duplication of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that would not be a good choice for this patient with heart failure.",False,model6

Various diagnostic tools such as physical examination, routine x-rays, barium enema, colposcopy, cystoscopy, proctosigmoidoscopy, and intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are employed for staging purposes. While CT scan findings are valuable clinically, they are not utilized for staging the disease. In the staging process: - Stage I indicates confinement to the cervix. Stage Ia refers to preclinical (microscopic) disease, whereas Stage Ib signifies macroscopic disease. - Stage II encompasses involvement of the vagina excluding the lower one-third or infiltration into the parametrium without extending to the pelvic side wall. Stage IIa indicates vaginal extension without parametrial involvement, while Stage IIb denotes parametrial extension. - Stage III involves invasion into the lower one-third of the vagina or reaching the pelvic side wall without any cancer-free region between the tumor and the pelvic wall. Stage IIIa denotes lesions confined to the lower one-third of the vagina without pelvic wall extension, while Stage IIIb indicates pelvic wall extension and/or tumor-related hydronephrosis or nonfunctional kidney. - Stage IV signifies cancer spreading beyond the reproductive tract.",IIa,IIb,IIIa,IIIb,IV,D,"D.

He was recently diagnosed with hypertension and initiated an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. EKG indicates peaked T waves. Electrolytes indicate potassium of 6.5 mEq/L. Prompt treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and sodium polystyrene sulfate is initiated. One hour after initiation, the patient begins to complain of pain at his IV site. On examination, the IV site is edematous, erythematous, and tender to palpation. What is the preferred subsequent management?
###Options:
A.  Intramuscular injection of epinephrine
B.  Intravenous hydrocortisone
C.  Topical mupirocin
D.  Intradermal hyaluronidase
E.  steroids

###Answer:",D,"The most concerning adverse effect of calcium gluconate is extravasation from intravenous sites. Calcium can induce tissue necrosis through calcium-induced vasoconstriction of capillaries and intracellular fluid retention, leading to deep tissue damage and late-onset calcifications (calcinosis cutis).

For extravasation injury treatment, stop the infusion and then gently aspirate the extravasated fluid. In early or acute calcium extravasation, a hyaluronidase antidote may be used in addition to cold, dry compresses and elevation of the extremity. 1 to 1.7 mL of hyaluronidase may be given intradermally into the border of the extravasated area as five separate injections. Injection into the catheter that caused the infiltration is also appropriate.

Calcium gluconate should be administered in large veins or via a central venous catheter to minimize the risk of extravasation injury.

Hyperkalemia with EKG changes requires prompt treatment with calcium to stabilize cardiomyocyte cell membranes. Insulin and dextrose are administered to shift potassium into cells, and sodium polystyrene sulfate causes increased potassium excretion through the stool.",Intramuscular injection of epinephrine,Intravenous hydrocortisone,Topical mupirocin,Intradermal hyaluronidase,steroids,D,"D.  Intradermal hyaluronidase

Rationale: The patient is experiencing calcium gluconate extravasation, which is a common complication of calcium gluconate administration. Calcium gluconate can cause local tissue necrosis and inflammation. Intradermal hyaluronidase is the preferred treatment for calcium gluconate extravasation, as it breaks down hyaluronic acid and allows for the dispersion of the calcium gluconate, reducing the local tissue reaction.",True,model6

Bromocriptine binds to D2 dopamine receptors on anterior pituitary lactotrophs, decreasing prolactin exocytosis

In Parkinson disease, the substantia nigra lacks dopaminergic neurons, which normally activate pro-kinetic pathways. D2 Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, can directly stimulate these pathways in the absence of endogenous dopamine and aid with movement

Schizophrenia is treated with dopamine receptor antagonists known as antipsychotics and would not be treated with a dopamine agonist. Although Huntington disease is also a movement disorder caused by problems in the pathways within the basal nuclei, it is not treated with bromocriptine",Parkinson disease,Schizophrenia,Huntington disease,Depression,mania,C,"C.  Huntington disease

Rationale: The symptoms described in the patient, such as headaches, changes in vision, and galactorrhea, are indicative of a pituitary tumor, specifically a prolactinoma. The presence of papilledema suggests increased intracranial pressure, which is a common complication of pituitary tumors. The medication most appropriate for this condition is a dopamine agonist, such as cabergoline or bromocriptine, which can help to reduce prolactin levels and shrink the tumor.

###Options:
A.  IV hypertonic saline
B.  IV dextrose
C.  Oral glucose tablets or gel
D.  IV glucagon
E.  Oral Vitamins

###Answer:",C,"The patient is hypoglycemic due to excessive insulin administration and needs glucose administration. Oral glucose tablets or gel are preferred in a conscious person with low glucose levels. In patients with loss of consciousness, IV dextrose use can reverse hypoglycemia.

For awake patients who can take oral medications, readily absorbable carbohydrate sources (such as fruit juice) could also be given when glucose tablets or gel are unavailable. The advantage of glucose tablets or gel is that they contain measured glucose, and the increase in the patient's glucose level will not be excessive.

A 1-mg intramuscular (IM) injection of glucagon can be administered for patients unable to take oral agents. Once the patient is awake, a complex carbohydrate food source should be given to the patient to achieve sustained euglycemia.

The clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia can be classified as either neuroglycopenic or neurogenic. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms include behavioral changes, confusion, dizziness, headache, fatigue, seizure, coma, and potential death if not immediately corrected. Neurogenic signs and symptoms can be adrenergic (tremors, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety) or cholinergic (hunger, diaphoresis, paresthesias).",IV hypertonic saline,IV dextrose,Oral glucose tablets or gel,IV glucagon,Oral Vitamins,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hypoglycemia, which is likely due to insulin administration without adequate food intake. The best initial step in the treatment of this patient is to administer IV dextrose (Option B). This will help to rapidly increase blood glucose levels and alleviate symptoms. IV glucagon (Option D) may also be used, but it is typically reserved for patients who are unable to take oral glucose or dextrose, such as those who are unconscious. Oral glucose tablets or gel (Option C) may be used in patients who are conscious and able to swallow, but IV dextrose is a more rapid and reliable way to increase blood glucose levels.

###Answer:",B,"The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of celiac sprue, mild rosacea, and frequent urinary tract infections. She has no symptoms of hypothyroidism or diabetes. The most appropriate management for her would be a bone density test. Celiac sprue is associated with decreased bone mineral density, and since the patient has had the condition for a long time, it is important to assess her bone health. The other options, such as TSH measurement, chlamydia infection testing, diabetes screening, and colon cancer screening, are not indicated based on the patient's history and symptoms.",TSH measurement,Bone density test,Chalamydia trachomatis infection,Diabetes screening,Colon cancer screening,A,"A

Rationale: The patient has a family history of hypothyroidism, which increases her risk for developing hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is reasonable to check her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level as a screening test. Although the patient has celiac sprue, she is adherent to a gluten-free diet and has no symptoms.

Rationale: 
For postoperative pain management in a patient undergoing laparotomy, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is the method of choice. PCA allows the patient to self-administer a predetermined dose of pain medication, usually an opioid, through a pump connected to an intravenous line. This method provides better pain control, increased patient satisfaction, and fewer side effects compared to as-needed pain medications.

Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain.

Rationale: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a deficiency of cholinergic neuronal function in the brain, which leads to a decrease in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which breaks down acetylcholine, would increase the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, potentially improving cognitive function.

###Options:
A.  Daily weights
B.  Seizure precautions
C.  Right lateral positioning
D.  Stress reduction
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Women hospitalized with severe preeclampsia need decreased CNS stimulation to prevent a seizure. Seizure precautions provide environmental safety should a seizure occur. Because of edema, daily weight is important but not the priority. Preclampsia causes vasospasm and therefore can reduce utero-placental perfusion.

Interventions to reduce stress and anxiety are very important to facilitate coping and a sense of control, but seizure precautions are the priority",Daily weights,Seizure precautions,Right lateral positioning,Stress reduction,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Seizure precautions are crucial in a patient with severe preeclampsia as the patient is at risk for developing eclampsia, a life-threatening complication characterized by seizures. This is especially important in a patient with a blood pressure of 160/110, which is significantly elevated. While daily weights (A) and right lateral positioning (C) are important in monitoring fluid status and promoting blood flow, respectively, they are not as critical as seizure precautions in this scenario.

###Answer:",A,"Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, which is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancer, by up to 80%. Additionally, they can lower the risk of endometrial cancer. However, they do not impact the risk of developing vulvar cancer. The question of whether oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer and cervical cancer remains a topic of debate. If there is any potential increase in breast cancer risk, it is likely to be very small and limited to a specific subgroup of women. Overall, the benefits of using oral contraceptives far outweigh any associated risks.",Ovarian,Breast,Endometrial,Cervical,Vulvar,A,"A

Rationale: Oral contraceptives (OCs) have been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and colorectal cancer. However, the most significant impact on gynecological mortality is attributed to the reduction in ovarian cancer risk. Studies have consistently demonstrated a 30-50% decrease in ovarian cancer risk with OC use, particularly for women who have used OCs for 5 or more years. This is likely due to the suppression of ovulation, which reduces the number of times the ovarian epithelium is exposed to potential carcinogens.",True,model6

Which of the following conditions is typically not associated with thrombocytosis?
###Options:
A.  Iron-deficiency anemia
B.  Essential thrombocytosis
C.  Chronic myeloid leukemia
D.  Myelodysplasia
E.  Pernicious anemia

###Answer:",E,"Thrombocytosis can be categorized as ""primary"" or ""secondary."" Essential thrombocytosis, a type of myeloproliferative disorder, involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell. However, distinguishing it from more common nonclonal, reactive forms of thrombocytosis can be challenging as there is no reliable clonal marker. Only around 50% of patients with essential thrombocytosis carry the JAK2 V617F mutation. Hence, diagnosis typically relies on excluding other potential causes. Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis encompass infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other myeloproliferative disorders like chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis, along with myelodysplastic syndromes such as the 5q-syndrome, may also lead to thrombocytosis. However, pernicious anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency usually does not induce thrombocytosis. Nonetheless, rectifying the deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate might lead to a ""rebound"" thrombocytosis. Similarly, discontinuation of chronic ethanol consumption may also trigger rebound thrombocytosis.",Iron-deficiency anemia,Essential thrombocytosis,Chronic myeloid leukemia,Myelodysplasia,Pernicious anemia,E,"E

Rationale: 
Thrombocytosis is typically associated with iron-deficiency anemia (A) as the body tries to compensate for the anemia by increasing platelet production. Essential thrombocytosis (B) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of platelets. Chronic myeloid leukemia (C) is a myeloproliferative disorder that can cause thrombocytosis.

1. Corona radiata: The sperm first encounters the corona radiata, a layer of cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. 
2. Zona pellucida: After penetrating the corona radiata, the sperm encounters the zona pellucida, a thick, glycoprotein-rich layer surrounding the oocyte. 
3. Perivitelline space: The sperm then enters the perivitelline space, a narrow region between the zona pellucida and the oocyte's plasma membrane.

Any drug that can increase the levels of ACh in the neuromuscular junction can improve symptoms in myasthenia gravis. Thus, cholinesterase inhibitors help to improve the symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Muscarinic drugs have no role in myasthenia gravis, and nicotinic antagonists will worsen the symptom",Nicotinic antagonists.,Muscarinic agonists,Muscarinic antagonists,Anticholinesterase agents,Antihypertensives,D,"D.  Anticholinesterase agents

Rationale: Myasthenia gravis is a condition characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. It is caused by an autoimmune response that leads to a decrease in the number of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Anticholinesterase agents, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine, increase the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, which helps to improve muscle strength and reduce fatigue. Therefore, anticholinesterase agents are useful in treating the symptoms of myasthenia gravis.",True,model6

Rationale: The symptoms described, such as dyspnoea, orthopnea, and early satiety, are indicative of biventricular heart failure. Dyspnoea and orthopnea suggest left heart failure, while early satiety suggests right heart failure. The presence of long-standing hypertension suggests that the patient may have developed hypertensive heart disease, which can lead to biventricular heart failure. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is biventricular heart failure secondary to hypertensive heart disease.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient has done relatively well since his surgery, and his current medications seem to be appropriate. His echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction, a well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve, and no wall motion abnormalities. His laboratory values are within acceptable ranges. His INR is slightly below the target range of 2.5-3.5 for a bioprosthetic aortic valve, but it is close enough to the target range that increasing his warfarin dose is not necessary at this time. The patient's diabetes is not well controlled, but discontinuing metformin and relying solely on diet and exercise is not a reasonable approach. His anticoagulation regimen is appropriate for a bioprosthetic aortic valve, and there is no indication to discontinue warfarin or aspirin.

A.  Esophageal atresia.
B.  Duodenal atresia.
C.  Pyloric atresia.
D.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
E.  Hirschsprung's disease

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is D.

Polyhydramnios, which refers to an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac during pregnancy, is frequently observed in various congenital anomalies that result in obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Let's analyze each option:

A. Esophageal atresia: Esophageal atresia, where the esophagus does not develop properly, can lead to polyhydramnios due to the inability of the fetus to swallow amniotic fluid.

B. Duodenal atresia: Duodenal atresia, a blockage in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), can cause polyhydramnios because the fetus is unable to process swallowed amniotic fluid properly.

C. Pyloric atresia: Pyloric atresia, a rare condition where there is a blockage at the outlet of the stomach (pylorus), can result in polyhydramnios due to the accumulation of swallowed amniotic fluid.

E. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia can cause compression of the fetal lungs, leading to inadequate lung development and reduced production of pulmonary surfactant. This can result in polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing and clearance of amniotic fluid.

Option D, Hirschsprung's disease, is not typically associated with polyhydramnios. Hirschsprung's disease involves the absence of nerve cells in the muscles of the colon, leading to difficulty passing stool. It is not directly related to obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract that would lead to polyhydramnios. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",Esophageal atresia.,Duodenal atresia.,Pyloric atresia.,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,Hirschsprung's disease,E,"E. Hirschsprung's disease

Rationale: Polyhydramnios is associated with conditions that obstruct the passage of amniotic fluid into the gastrointestinal tract, such as esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia, and pyloric atresia. Hirschsprung's disease, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by an aganglionic segment of the colon, which does not obstruct the passage of amniotic fluid into the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore is not typically associated with polyhydramnios.",False,model6

He is concerned because he has found it difficult to see objects in the distance, in addition to worries that he has become colour blind. Which of his medications is most likely to be causing this defect?
###Options:
A.  Ethambutol
B.  Isoniazid
C.  Prednisolone
D.  Pyraziniamide
E.  Rifampicin

###Answer:",A,"Side-effects of ethambutol include visual disturbances in the form of loss of acuity, colour blindness, and restriction of visual fields.

His history is significant for obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Physical examination reveals 2/5 muscle strength and hyperreflexia in the upper and lower extremities on the left side. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his signs and symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Diabetes mellitus
B.  Hypertension
C.  Stroke
D.  Obesity
E.  hypernatremia

###Answer:",C,"The differential for upper motor neuron signs includes strokes, malignancies, traumatic brain injury, infections, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Strokes are defined as the sudden cessation of blood flow to various areas of the brain resulting in neuronal cell death. Due to the vast areas spanned by the pyramidal tract, upper motor neurons are vulnerable to many stroke syndromes.

Upper motor neuron lesion signs can be divided into negative and positive signs. Positive signs refer to symptoms that exhibit increased muscle activity and exaggerated spinal reflexes. These include hyperreflexia, propagation of reflexes, clonus, spasticity, flexor and extensor spasms, co-contraction, synkinesias, and spastic dystonia. Negative symptoms are those that involve loss of motor control. These include weakness, loss of dexterity, fatigue, and impaired motor planning and control.

Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension can predispose to a stroke, which eventually leads to upper motor neuron damage, but they can not directly cause damage to the upper motor neurons.",Diabetes mellitus,Hypertension,Stroke,Obesity,hypernatremia,C,"C. Stroke

Rationale: The patient's sudden onset of left-sided weakness and numbness, along with hyperreflexia in the upper and lower extremities on the left side, is consistent with a stroke. The patient's age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are all risk factors for stroke. While the patient's obesity may contribute to his overall health, it is not directly related to the symptoms presented. Diabetes mellitus can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it would not typically cause sudden onset of weakness and numbness on one side of the body. Hypertension can contribute to stroke risk, but it is not the direct cause of the symptoms. Hypernatremia can cause neurological symptoms, but they would typically be more diffuse and not lateralized to one side of the body.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Wound infection
B.  Bacterial resistance to current antibiotic therapy
C.  Intra-abdominal collection
D.  Urinary Tract Infection
E.  Lower lobe pneumonia

###Answer:",C,"Perforated appendices are common in children as it is more difficult to surgically assess an unwell child due to poor localisation of abdominal pain, and their inability to express discomfort. They are therefore prone to a greater risk of post operative complications including would infections, intra abdominal fluid collections, and chest infections. In the above scenario the spiking temperature points to an abscess, which characteristically presents with a swinging temperature. The fever is unlikely due to bacterial resistance as blood tests performed post surgery would have indicated any resistance, and a UTI is also unlikely since the child is already on antibiotics. As his chest is clinically clear, a severe chest infection may be ruled out, leaving intra-abdominal collection as the most likely explanation.",Wound infection,Bacterial resistance to current antibiotic therapy,Intra-abdominal collection,Urinary Tract Infection,Lower lobe pneumonia,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of intermittent temperature spikes, particularly in the post-operative period, suggest an intra-abdominal collection or abscess. The fact that he has opened his bowels with diarrhoea suggests that the appendix has been successfully removed, and the diarrhoea may be related to the antibiotics he is receiving. The clear chest examination makes pneumonia less likely. Wound infection is possible but less likely given the laparoscopic approach. Bacterial resistance to current antibiotic therapy is also possible but less likely given the patient's recent surgery.

###Answer:",A,"Indomethacin is a non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used to treat acute gout exacerbations.

Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit COX1 and COX2. These enzymes are responsible for prostaglandin synthesis, which is responsible for the protection of the GI mucosa.

NSAIDs are associated with peptic ulcers because of this disruption.

He reported no antecedent trauma, and the pain was worse in the morning on awakening. The medical history was noncontributory. On physical examination, there was conjunctival erythema of the affected eye, with no evidence of a foreign body. Results of fluorescein staining indicated a corneal ulcer. The patient was prescribed pain medication and was counseled to call the next day if there was no resolution or worsening of symptoms. The patient calls the next day, stating that his pain has gotten progressively worse and there is a mucopurulent discharge from his eye. Which of the following possible patient factors is likely to be helpful in establishing a diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  History of diabetes mellitus
B.  Contact lens use
C.  Swimming
D.  History of chronic allergic conjunctivitis
E.  History of systemic lupus erythematosus

###Answer:",B,"Contact lens use is likely to be helpful in establishing a diagnosis because it increases the risk of corneal ulcers. Contact lenses can cause microtrauma to the cornea, which can lead to the development of ulcers. Additionally, contact lens use can increase the risk of infection, which can also cause symptoms such as eye pain and discharge. Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and the presence of a corneal ulcer, contact lens use is a relevant factor to consider in the diagnosis.",History of diabetes mellitus,Contact lens use,Swimming,History of chronic allergic conjunctivitis,History of systemic lupus erythematosus,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and signs, including a corneal ulcer, worsening pain, and mucopurulent discharge, suggest an infectious etiology. Contact lens use is a risk factor for corneal ulcers, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The presence of a corneal ulcer in a contact lens wearer should raise suspicion for a Pseudomonas infection. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of worsening pain and mucopurulent discharge. The other options do not have a direct correlation with the development of a corneal ulcer. Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for other eye problems, such as retinopathy, but not typically for corneal ulcers. Swimming may increase the risk of conjunctivitis, but it is not directly related to corneal ulcers. Allergic conjunctivitis and systemic lupus erythematosus are not typically associated with corneal ulcers.",True,model6

C.  The maternal and fetal adrenal glands secrete large amounts of androgenic steroids that are used by the placenta to form estrogen
D.  The placenta secretes large amounts of estrogen, some of which is metabolized to testosterone
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",C,"Estrogen secreted by the placenta is not synthesized from basic substrates in the placenta. Instead, it is formed almost entirely from androgenic steroid compounds that are formed in both the mothers and the fetuss adrenal glands. These androgenic compounds are transported by the blood to the placenta and converted by the trophoblast cells to estrogen compounds. Their concentration in the maternal blood may also stimulate hair growth on the body.",The ovaries secrete some testosterone along with the large amounts of estrogen produced late in pregnancy,The fetal ovaries and testes secrete androgenic steroids,The maternal and fetal adrenal glands secrete large amounts of androgenic steroids that are used by the placenta to form estrogen,"The placenta secretes large amounts of estrogen, some of which is metabolized to testosterone",None of the above,C,"C

Rationale: During pregnancy, the maternal and fetal adrenal glands secrete large amounts of androgenic steroids, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS). The placenta uses these steroids to form estrogen, but some of the androgenic steroids escape metabolism and enter the maternal circulation, causing an increase in body hair growth in a masculine pattern.

After thoroughly examining the systems, the clinician suspects the patient may have an underlying thyroid pathology. A preliminary serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) analysis is much lower than normal. Which condition could explain the disease process of the patient?
###Options:
A.  Toxic adenoma
B.  Toxic adenoma
C.  Subacute thyroiditis
D.  Subacute thyroiditis
E.  None

###Answer:",A,"Follicular adenomas usually present as solitary thyroid nodules. As part of routine assessment, baseline thyroid function tests are done.

A low TSH level should raise suspicion of toxic adenoma. These patients could have signs of hyperthyroidism like weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, and muscle tremors. If so, free T3 and T4 levels should be determined. If the patient is not euthyroid, prior medication must be provided to ensure a clinically euthyroid state. If not treated appropriately, surgical complications like a thyroid storm can occur.

In such cases, an Iodine-131 scan could help confirm the functional status of the nodule.

Infected thyroglossal cysts and subacute thyroiditis are unlikely as the patient has no history of fever, pain, or other symptoms. Moreover, a thyroglossal cyst is a congenital anomaly that could contain ectopic thyroid tissue. In this case, it is unlikely. Anaplastic carcinoma usually affects older people and is aggressive. Constitutional symptoms like weight loss may occur concurrently. In this case, again, the diagnosis of malignancy is unlikely.",Toxic adenoma,Toxic adenoma,Subacute thyroiditis,Subacute thyroiditis,,B,"B.  Toxic adenoma

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including weight loss, palpitations, and heat intolerance, suggest hyperthyroidism. The low TSH level supports this diagnosis. The fine needle aspiration report showing a follicular neoplasm suggests a possibility of a follicular adenoma or carcinoma. However, given the patient's symptoms and low TSH, a toxic adenoma is more likely. This is a benign tumor that produces excess thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis, on the other hand, is an inflammatory condition that typically presents with pain and tenderness in the thyroid gland, which is not described in this patient.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Eyedrops
B.  Corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses)
C.  Laser surgery
D.  Eye exercises
E.  Vitamins and supplements

###Answer:",B,Corrective lenses are commonly used to improve vision in individuals with refractive errors by adjusting how light enters the eye.,Eyedrops,Corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses),Laser surgery,Eye exercises,Vitamins and supplements,B,"B. Corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses)

Rationale: Refractive errors like myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness) occur when the shape of the cornea or lens of the eye is not ideal, causing light to focus in front of or behind the retina instead of directly on it. The primary treatment for these conditions is to use corrective lenses, such as glasses or contact lenses, to refract light properly and focus it on the retina. This allows the individual to see clearly and comfortably. While laser surgery (option C) may be used to correct refractive errors in some cases, it is not the primary treatment. Options A, D, and E are not directly related to the correction of refractive errors.",True,model6

She also reports unintentional weight loss. On abdominal examination, percussion revealed tympanic resonance in the hypogastric region. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography reveals echogenic peritoneal masses, scalloping of the liver, and an appendiceal mucocele. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a 10 cm x 8 cm x 5 cm fluid mass covering the uterus and the ovaries as well as a dilated appendix filled with fluid. A laparoscopic biopsy is done. Which histological finding would have the worst prognosis?
###Options:
A.  Disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis
B.  Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis without signet ring cells
C.  Ovarian cancer
D.  Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with signet ring cells
E.  Ovarian dysplasia

###Answer:",D,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare clinical entity, characterized by diffuse intra-abdominal gelatinous ascites, the so-called jelly belly, with mucinous implants on peritoneal surfaces.

Any lesion with a component of signet ring cells is classified separately because of their worse prognosis compared to other subgroups of otherwise similar histology.

Signet ring cells mainly come from GI malignancies including stomach, colon, and appendiceal adenocarcinoma.

Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis generally presents with a worse prognosis than disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis and acellular mucin because of a higher grade of cellular components with atypia and mitotic activities.",Disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis,Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis without signet ring cells,Ovarian cancer,Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with signet ring cells,Ovarian dysplasia,D,"D. Peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with signet ring cells

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). PMP is a rare condition characterized by the presence of mucinous tumors in the peritoneal cavity. The histological findings can be classified into three categories: disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), and PMCA with signet ring cells. Among these, PMCA with signet ring cells has the worst prognosis, as it is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and mortality. Signet ring cells are a type of cancer cell that produces mucin, and their presence indicates a more aggressive tumor. DPAM has a better prognosis, while PMCA without signet ring cells has an intermediate prognosis. Ovarian cancer and ovarian dysplasia are not directly related to PMP and are not the correct answers in this context.",True,model6

Which of the following complications would not be expected during his treatment?
###Options:
A.  Hyperkalemia
B.  Acute kidney injury.
C.  Hyperuricemia
D.  Hyperphosphatemia
E.  Hypercalcemia

###Answer:",E,"Tumor lysis syndrome primarily affects individuals undergoing chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating malignancies, such as acute leukemias and Burkitts lymphoma, though it can rarely occur in chronic lymphomas or solid tumors. The syndrome arises due to the massive destruction of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in the release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This cascade leads to a characteristic metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is a common complication, potentially progressing to renal failure, especially if uric acid crystallizes within renal tubules, necessitating hemodialysis. Lactic acidosis and dehydration heighten the risk of acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia arises from the release of intracellular phosphate ions, leading to a reciprocal decrease in serum calcium levels. Profound hypocalcemia can ensue, causing neuromuscular irritability and tetany. Hyperkalemia, which can rapidly become life-threatening, may provoke ventricular arrhythmias.",Hyperkalemia,Acute kidney injury.,Hyperuricemia,Hyperphosphatemia,Hypercalcemia,E,"E. Hypercalcemia

Rationale: The patient is at risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) due to the high white blood cell count. TLS is a complication of chemotherapy treatment of rapidly proliferating tumors, characterized by the rapid destruction of cancer cells and the release of their intracellular contents into the bloodstream. The metabolic disturbances associated with TLS include hyperkalemia (A), hyperuricemia (C), and hyperphosphatemia (D), which can lead to acute kidney injury (B). Hypercalcemia (E) is not a typical feature of TLS.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Low amplitude ECG
B.  Electrical alternans
C.  Pulsus paradoxus
D.  Raised plasma lactate
E.  Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. A large pericardial effusion reduces the amplitude of the ECG as the myocardial tissue is further away from the recording electrodes. The heart may rotate within the pericardial sac so that there is a motion artefact on the ECG (electrical alternans). There may be an increased fall in blood pressure on inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) as the increased venous return to the right heart causes the septum to bulge into the left ventricle, impeding cardiac output. Concave ST elevation in a pattern that does not correspond to coronary ischaemia is typical of pericarditis, which may be complicated by pericardial tamponade. Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF is typical of an inferior myocardial infarction. Rarely this could lead to myocardial rupture and tamponade but would usually result in sudden death.",Low amplitude ECG,Electrical alternans,Pulsus paradoxus,Raised plasma lactate,"Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF",E,"E.  Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF

Rationale: 
The patient presents with a large pericardial effusion and shock, which is consistent with cardiac tamponade. 
Cardiac tamponade is characterized by a few ECG features, including low amplitude ECG (A), electrical alternans (B), and pulsus paradoxus (C). 
Electrical alternans is a beat-to-beat variation in the amplitude of the QRS complex, which is often seen in cardiac tamponade. 
Pulsus paradoxus is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg during inspiration. 
However, convex ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (E) is not a typical feature of cardiac tamponade.

D.  The mortality rate for this child is approximately 50%

###Answer:",A,"The correct statements regarding the scenario described are:

a. Empiric antibiotic coverage for beta-hemolytic Streptococci and Escherichia coli should be initiated: True. The sudden onset of hypoxemia, irritability, and instability in glucose and temperature in a term infant could be indicative of early-onset neonatal sepsis, which commonly involves pathogens like beta-hemolytic Streptococci and Escherichia coli. Therefore, empiric antibiotic therapy targeting these organisms should be initiated promptly.

d. The mortality rate for this child is approximately 50%: True. Early-onset neonatal sepsis, if left untreated, can have a high mortality rate. However, with prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate can be significantly reduced, but it remains a serious condition.

E.  Start propanolol

###Answer:",B,"Antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid, increase the likelihood of neural tube defects in a fetus.

Generally, these drugs should only be continued during pregnancy for the management of epilepsy. Antiepileptic drugs should not be used during pregnancy for other conditions, such as migraines.

Antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid, reduce folic acid absorption, which increases the risk of neural tube defects. Increasing folic acid dosage would not be as effective as cessation of valproic acid.

Thyroglobulin increases during pregnancy, so a pregnant patient taking thyroid medication must increase their dose, lest the increased thyroglobulin binds too much of the medication and causes a hypothyroid state. Despite her family history, this patient is not currently hypertensive and does not require nifedipine.",Increase levothyroxine dose,Replace valproic acid with another medication,Increase folic acid dose,Start nifedipine,Start propanolol,B,"B

Rationale: Valproic acid is a known teratogen that can cause neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. The best initial step in management to prevent NTDs in the fetus is to replace valproic acid with another medication for migraine prophylaxis. This should be done under the guidance of a neurologist or a primary care physician. It is essential to ensure that the woman is seizure-free before conception. Other options are not directly related to preventing NTDs. Increasing folic acid dose is recommended for all women of childbearing age to prevent NTDs, but in this case, replacing valproic acid is a more critical step.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Heartburn
B.  Regurgitation
C.  Dysphagia
D.  Chest pain
E.  Constipation

###Answer:",E,"
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) typically presents with symptoms such as heartburn (A), regurgitation (B), and chest pain (D) due to the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. Dysphagia (C), or difficulty swallowing, can also occur in severe cases of GERD, but it is less common as a primary symptom. Constipation (E) is not typically associated with GERD; instead, it may be a symptom of other gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or constipation-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders",Heartburn,Regurgitation,Dysphagia,Chest pain,Constipation,E,"E. Constipation

Rationale: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is characterized by symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Chest pain can also be a symptom, especially if it is worsened by lying down or bending over. However, constipation is not typically associated with GERD. In fact, GERD symptoms are often worsened by constipation, as increased intra-abdominal pressure can exacerbate reflux.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Lactose intolerance
B.  Pernicious anaemia
C.  Lymphocytic colitis
D.  Small bowel bacterial overgrowth

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is D. Lactose intolerance causes diarrhoea due to colonic fermenation. Lymphocytic colitis causes colonic diarrhoea, whereas pernicious anaemia results in selective deficiency of vitamin B12. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth can occur secondary to jejunal diverticulosis or small bowel motility problems (e.g. systemic sclerosis) and results in small bowel malabsorption.",Lactose intolerance,Pernicious anaemia,Lymphocytic colitis,Small bowel bacterial overgrowth,,D,"D. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth

Rationale: 
Weight loss and malabsorption are common features of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO). This is because the bacteria in the small intestine interfere with the digestion and absorption of nutrients, leading to malabsorption and weight loss. Lactose intolerance (A) may cause bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but weight loss is not a typical feature. Pernicious anemia (B) is a condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency, which may cause weight loss, but it is not primarily a malabsorptive disorder. Lymphocytic colitis (C) is a type of microscopic colitis that may cause diarrhea and abdominal pain, but weight loss is not a common feature.",True,model6

Imaging demonstrates a massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis. He undergoes catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the patient is being monitored closely in the ICU. After several hours his fibrinogen level is checked and is found to be less than 100mg/dL. If the infusion is not stopped, the patient is most at risk for which of the following complications?
###Options:
A.  Myocardial rupture
B.  Limb loss
C.  Hypotension
D.  Bleeding complications
E.  Arrythmia

###Answer:",D,"The major and most feared complication of thrombolytic therapy is bleeding complications, most notably intracranial hemorrhage. Other complications include systemic hemorrhage, immunologic complications, hypotension, and myocardial rupture.

Fibrinogen levels must be monitored closely in patients undergoing thrombolysis to ensure they are above 150mg/dL. When levels drop below 150mg/dL, this poses a significant bleeding risk. Treatment includes reducing and stopping the infusion rate below 100mg/dL. Platelets and hemoglobin levels should also be monitored closely as well.

Hypotension is a known risk with ""reperfusion""; however, generally, this can be controlled with infusions and will ultimately resolve as the infusion is stopped and the patient is resuscitated adequately.

Myocardial rupture is a known complication when tPA is used to treat patients who suffer from a myocardial infarction but is less commonly associated with catheter-directed thrombolysis for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).",Myocardial rupture,Limb loss,Hypotension,Bleeding complications,Arrythmia,D,"D. Bleeding complications

Rationale: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve blood clots. It works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin, a key component of blood clots. During thrombolysis, the fibrinogen level is monitored to ensure that the patient is not at risk for bleeding complications. A fibrinogen level less than 100mg/dL indicates that the patient is at risk for bleeding complications, as the thrombolytic agent has broken down too much fibrinogen. In this scenario, if the infusion is not stopped, the patient is most at risk for bleeding complications.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"The child may have Hirschsprung disease, given the lifelong history of constipation and dependence on stool softeners.

Only 3 percent of patients have fecal soiling.

Rectal manometry and barium enema will aid in the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis is made by punch or suction biopsy.

The pathology will show an aganglionic bowel segment, and the treatment is surgical resection of the affected segment of bowel.",Add stimulant laxative to stool softeners,Rectal manometry and barium enema,Request an abdominal CT-scan with intravenous contrast,Administer oral multivitamins and further assessment 6 weeks later,Abdominal USS,B,"B. Rectal manometry and barium enema

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of delayed first stool passage and subsequent constipation are suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. The patient's history of first-week icterus and need for blood exchange may indicate an underlying genetic disorder. The patient's symptoms are not controlled with stool softeners, and further evaluation is needed. Rectal manometry and barium enema are diagnostic tests for Hirschsprung's disease. Rectal manometry can help identify the absence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, which is characteristic of Hirschsprung's disease.

###Answer:",D,"The presentation described is suggestive of colorectal carcinoma. The symptoms of left lower abdominal pain, bloody stool, cough, weight loss, along with the examination findings of pallor and a soft, non-tender mass in the left lower abdomen, are indicative of advanced colorectal carcinoma. So, the likely diagnosis is D. Colorectal Carcinoma.",Crohns disease,Tuberculosis of the Colon and Rectum,Amebiasis with ameboma,Colorectal carcinoma,Ulcerative Colitis,E,"E. Ulcerative Colitis

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of bloody stools, weight loss, and abdominal pain, along with the presence of a soft, non-tender mass in the left lower abdomen, suggest a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. The mass is likely a palpable colon, which is a common finding in ulcerative colitis. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with chronic inflammation of the colon, which is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis. While Crohn's disease and tuberculosis of the colon and rectum can also cause similar symptoms, the presence of a palpable colon and the lack of other symptoms such as diarrhea or abdominal tenderness make ulcerative colitis the most likely diagnosis. Amebiasis with ameboma is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the lack of other signs of amebiasis, such as fever or abdominal tenderness.

Rationale: The umbilical arteries, which are two vessels that arise from the internal iliac arteries, carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta for oxygenation and nutrient uptake. The umbilical vein, which is a single vessel, carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. The pH of the umbilical artery is typically lower than that of the umbilical vein, reflecting the higher carbon dioxide levels in the fetal circulation. In the context of evaluating fetal distress, a low umbilical artery pH may indicate fetal acidosis.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with von Willebrand disease (vWD), a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is a protein produced by endothelial cells that plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation. In vWD, platelet function is impaired, leading to prolonged bleeding time and easy bruising. The impaired platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine further supports this diagnosis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) would not typically cause impaired platelet aggregation, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) would present with more severe systemic symptoms.

C.  Advise chlorhexidine mouthwashes for the next week
D.  Prescribe ibuprofen as an analgesic
E.  Take an intraoral radiograph of the area to help your clinical assessment and decisionmaking, but make sure that the patient is wearing a lead apron

###Answer:",C,"A developing fetus (especially between 3 and 7 weeks) is susceptible to ionising radiation.However, unless the primary beam is aimed at the pelvic region, the risk is very low. Indental radiography, provided that all the usual routine radiation protection measures aretaken, the risk is so low that it is not necessary to take any extra precautions and the takingof radiographs is not contraindicated. If it does not affect the clinical management, it ispossible for the patient to delay having the radiograph taken. In this case, however, thepatient is in pain and it is not possible to accurately diagnose or treat the patient without aradiograph; it would be inappropriate to decline to take a radiograph if the patient werewilling to have one done. The use of a lead apron is not necessary for intraoral orpanoramic dental radiography. The only situation when a lead apron would be used iswhen the primary beam is aimed at the abdomen and hence the developing fetus, eg in avertex occlusal radiograph.Metronidazole and NSAIDs are best avoided in pregnancy",Decline to take a radiograph of the area because the patient is pregnant and this may harm the developing baby,Prescribe a course of oral metronidazole 200 mg three times daily for 5 days,Advise chlorhexidine mouthwashes for the next week,Prescribe ibuprofen as an analgesic,"Take an intraoral radiograph of the area to help your clinical assessment and decisionmaking, but make sure that the patient is wearing a lead apron",E,"E. Take an intraoral radiograph of the area to help your clinical assessment and decisionmaking, but make sure that the patient is wearing a lead apron

Rationale: The patient is pregnant and has a dental infection. A radiograph is necessary to assess the tooth and surrounding tissues. Although radiographs should be avoided during pregnancy, the risk to the fetus is low and the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk. The patient should wear a lead apron to minimize radiation exposure.

Reassurance and kick counts at home.

Rationale: The patient has a normal/reactive CTG, which suggests that the fetus is not in distress. A normal CTG in a low-risk pregnancy at 37 weeks gestation is reassuring. In this scenario, it is reasonable to reassure the patient and ask her to perform kick counts at home. Kick counts are a simple and effective way to monitor fetal movements. The patient should be instructed to count the number of kicks or movements in a day and report back if the movements continue to be reduced. This approach is cost-effective and non-invasive. Induction of labor is not necessary at this point, as there is no evidence of fetal distress. Repeat CTG in 6 or 24 hours may be done if the patient continues to perceive reduced movements, but it is not necessary at this point. Ultrasound for fetal growth, liquor, and umbilical artery Doppler may be done if there are concerns about fetal growth restriction, but it is not necessary in this scenario.",False,model6

A.  Amiodarone
B.  Adenosine
C.  Magnesium sulfate
D.  Sotalol
E.  Propanolol

###Answer:",C,"The electrocardiogram shows torsades de pointes (TdP), which is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a cyclic alteration of wide QRS complexes. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice in conscious and stable patients with episodes of TdP. This is followed by the removal of the offending agents or causes. Intravenous magnesium is effective even in patients with normal magnesium levels. TdP occurs in the setting of congenital or acquired QT interval prolongation. This patient has most likely medication-induced QT prolongation (due to levofloxacin and citalopram) in addition to underlying cardiomyopathy, that predisposes him to develop (TdP).

This patient has TdP, and amiodarone has no role in the management of this patient. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug and is used both in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It is used occasionally in patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (and normal baseline QT interval) due to myocardial ischemia or infarction.

Adenosine is the drug of choice for the acute termination of supraventricular tachycardia, more specifically atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). It is not recommended for wide-complex ventricular tachycardia.

Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that causes QT prolongation so it is not useful in this setting.",Amiodarone,Adenosine,Magnesium sulfate,Sotalol,Propanolol,C,"C. Magnesium sulfate

Rationale: The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The patient is experiencing palpitations, which are likely related to the atrial fibrillation. The patient is already on beta-blockers, which should have slowed down the heart rate. However, the patient is experiencing a rapid heart rate, suggesting that the beta-blockers are not effective in this case. The patient has a history of COPD, and therefore, the use of additional beta-blockers is contraindicated. Levofloxacin is known to prolong the QT interval, which can contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation. Magnesium sulfate is often used to treat atrial fibrillation, especially when it is related to QT prolongation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer magnesium sulfate.",True,model6

Semantic, alzheimers

Rationale: 
Semantic paraphasic errors occur when a patient uses a word that is related to the correct word in meaning, but not exactly the same. In this case, the patient correctly associates the beaver with cutting down trees, but uses the word ""teeth"" instead of ""incisors"" or ""front teeth"".

 medication used for detrusor overactivity?
###Options:
A.  Botulinum toxin
B.  Tamsulosin
C.  Vasopressin
D.  Terazosin
E.  Oxybutynin

###Answer:",E,"Each drug listed serves a purpose in treating bladder dysfunction. Oxybutynin, an antimuscarinic, reduces detrusor overactivity, aiding in neurogenic bladder from suprapontine and cord lesions. Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release locally, injected into the bladder walls to reduce overactivity. Terazosin and tamsulosin, alpha-antagonists, relax the internal urethral sphincter, facilitating urinary flow, especially effective in bladder outflow obstruction like prostate hyperplasia. Vasopressin (DDAVP), a natural hormone, is used synthetically to lessen urinary production, primarily preventing nocturnal incontinence in neurogenic bladder dysfunction scenarios.",Botulinum toxin,Tamsulosin,Vasopressin,Terazosin,Oxybutynin,E,"E. Oxybutynin

Rationale: Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic medication that is commonly used to treat detrusor overactivity, which is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. It works by blocking the muscarinic receptors in the bladder, thereby reducing muscle contractions and increasing bladder capacity.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Amoxicillin
B.  Acetaminophen
C.  Ibuprofen
D.  Topical ear drops
E.  Observation without antibiotics

Amoxicillin

Rationale: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends antibiotic therapy as the first-line treatment for acute otitis media (AOM) in children younger than 6 months of age. Amoxicillin is the recommended antibiotic of choice. This is because AOM in this age group is more likely to be caused by a bacterial pathogen, and antibiotic therapy can help to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as prevent complications. In contrast, observation without antibiotics is recommended for children older than 6 months of age with uncomplicated AOM.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Red blood cells
B.  Platelets
C.  Plasma
D.  White blood cells
E.  Fibrinogen

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is (C) Plasma. Plasma proteins, such as albumin, exert oncotic pressure, which helps to maintain blood volume and prevent fluid from leaking out of blood vessels into tissues.",Red blood cells,Platelets,Plasma,White blood cells,Fibrinogen,C,"C. Plasma

Rationale: Colloid osmotic pressure, also known as oncotic pressure, is a force that prevents fluid from leaking out of blood vessels and into the surrounding tissues, thus preventing edema. This pressure is primarily generated by proteins in the blood plasma, particularly albumin. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood that carries cells, proteins, nutrients, hormones, gases, and waste products throughout the body. It makes up about 55% of total blood volume and is responsible for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure. While other blood components, such as red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells, play important roles in various physiological processes, they are not primarily responsible for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure. Fibrinogen is a protein involved in blood clotting, but it is not the primary component responsible for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure.",True,model6

Rationale: Gastric outlet obstruction is characterized by vomiting of food and gastric secretions that have not entered the small intestine, hence no bile. The vomitus is typically non-bilious. Metabolic alkalosis occurs due to loss of hydrogen ions in the vomitus. The urine pH is low (<7) due to the kidneys' attempt to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis by excreting more hydrogen ions. Vomiting may provide temporary relief from symptoms, but the obstruction remains. Gastric peristalsis is increased in an attempt to overcome the obstruction.",False,model6

Rationale: The patient is presenting with acute STEMI, given the ECG findings of ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V1-V4. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) such as jugular venous distention and crackles in all lung fields. Given the 2-hour delay in presentation, PCI is not an option at the community hospital, and transfer to the tertiary care hospital would require an additional 60-minute delay. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer MONA, heparin, and thrombolytic therapy to help restore coronary blood flow and reduce the risk of further ischemia and mortality.

He is not taking any medications but was given an oral medication prophylactically on the 10th day of life due to the father's infection with Bordetella pertussis. On physical examination, the clinician palpates an olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. What is the most likely adverse effect associated with the medication given?
###Options:
A.  Pyloric stenosis
B.  Small bowel obstruction
C.  Ogilvie syndrome
D.  Intussusception
E.  Large bowel obstruction

###Answer:",A,"This patient with projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant has hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Macrolides, such as erythromycin, serve as prophylaxis for Bordetella pertussis infections. The boy was given erythromycin as a prophylactic measure because his father tested positive.

Of all the macrolides, erythromycin, in particular, increases the risk of pyloric stenosis in newborns.

Exposure to erythromycin between 3 and 13 days of life is associated with an increased risk of pyloric stenosis.",Pyloric stenosis,Small bowel obstruction,Ogilvie syndrome,Intussusception,Large bowel obstruction,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is experiencing symptoms of pyloric stenosis, which is an adverse effect associated with erythromycin use. Erythromycin is often given to newborns to prevent pertussis infection. It can cause pyloric stenosis by increasing the motility of the pyloric muscle, leading to hypertrophy and subsequent obstruction. The olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is a classic finding in pyloric stenosis.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,"HIV/AIDS weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to various opportunistic infections and diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the most common opportunistic infections that affect people living with HIV/AIDS, particularly in Africa where both HIV and TB are highly prevalent.The interaction between HIV and TB is bidirectional, meaning that having HIV increases the risk of developing tuberculosis, and tuberculosis can also accelerate the progression of HIV infection. When a person with HIV becomes infected with TB, their weakened immune system is less able to control the TB bacteria, leading to an increased likelihood of active TB disease. TB can affect various organs, most commonly the lungs, but it can also involve other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes, bones, and brain.",Tuberculosis,Cryptococcal meningitis,Pneumocystis pneumonia,Kaposi sarcoma,Lymphoma,A,"A

Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa. TB is a major opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, particularly in resource-limited settings. In Africa, TB is responsible for approximately 30% of all HIV-related deaths. The high burden of TB in HIV-infected individuals is attributed to the compromised immune system, which increases the risk of reactivation of latent TB infection or rapid progression of newly acquired TB infection.",True,model6

Retrograde menstruation is a widely accepted theory that suggests that endometrial cells are refluxed through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity during menstruation, where they implant and grow.

Celomic metaplasia theory proposes that endometrial tissue arises from the celomic epithelium of the peritoneum.

Hematogenous dissemination and lymphatic exfoliation theories suggest that endometrial cells are transported through the blood vessels or lymphatic channels to distant sites, where they implant and grow.

C.  Deletion of the ³-globin gene
D.  Overexpression of the ´-globin gene
E.  Mutation in the hemoglobin A gene

###Answer:",A,"Correct answer: A) Mutation in the ²-globin geneExplanation: Sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation in the ²-globin gene on chromosome 11, leading to the substitution of glutamic acid with valine at the sixth position of the ²-globin chain. This mutation results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. Options B, C, D, and E do not accurately represent the primary genetic defect associated with sickle cell disease.",Mutation in the ²-globin gene,Mutation in the ±-globin gene,Deletion of the ³-globin gene,Overexpression of the ´-globin gene,Mutation in the hemoglobin A gene,A,"A. Mutation in the ²-globin gene

Rationale: Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The primary genetic defect underlying sickle cell disease is a point mutation in the ²-globin gene, which codes for the ²-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at the sixth position of the ²-globin chain, resulting in the production of HbS. The other options are not correct because mutations in the ±-globin gene are associated with ±-thalassemia, deletion of the ³-globin gene is associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, overexpression of the ´-globin gene is associated with ´-²-thalassemia, and mutation in the hemoglobin A gene is not a recognized genetic defect.",True,model6

Rationale: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to significant atrophy in various regions of the brain, particularly in the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. However, the occipital lobe, which is primarily responsible for visual processing, is relatively spared. This is because the occipital lobe is less affected by the neurotoxic effects of alcohol compared to other brain regions.",False,model6

She mentions taking large amounts of vitamins to prevent cancer and infections. Her symptoms are most likely caused by an excess of:
###Options:
A.  Vitamin A
B.  Vitamin B
C.  Vitamin C
D.  Vitamin D
E.  Vitamin K

###Answer:",A,"Chronic vitamin A toxicity, typically occurring with doses of 25,000 units or more over an extended period, can lead to various symptoms. These include bone pain, hyperostosis (excessive bone growth), hair loss, dryness, fissures of the lips, and weight loss.

High doses of vitamin C taken for prolonged periods may increase the risk of developing oxalate kidney stones and cause uricosuria (excretion of uric acid in urine).

Excessive vitamin E levels are observed in individuals receiving anticoagulants and premature infants. This excess can lead to prolonged prothrombin time (a measure of blood clotting).

Vitamin D excess results in hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels).

While vitamin B1 (thiamine) excess has not been well-described, vitamin K excess can interfere with the effects of anticoagulants.

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question, such as hair loss, bone pain, and dryness with fissures of the lips, are all consistent with vitamin A toxicity. Vitamin A toxicity can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin problems, hair loss, bone pain, and liver damage. The patient's history of taking large amounts of vitamins to prevent cancer and infections suggests that she may be taking excessive amounts of vitamin A, which is known for its antioxidant properties and is often taken in large doses by individuals who believe it can prevent cancer and other diseases.",True,model6

He describes sharp pain that radiates to the groin that is similar to his previous kidney stones. A review of systems is positive for worsening heartburn. His medical history includes recurrent kidney stones, GERD, and low testosterone. Daily medications include omeprazole, calcium carbonate antacids, and testosterone replacement. His father has a history of multiple kidney stones as well. His vital signs are blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 19 breaths/min, and temperature 99 °F (37.2 °C). Abdominal examination shows right costovertebral tenderness but no other abnormalities. Laboratory test results show elevated serum calcium and blood in his urine. Non-contrast abdomen/pelvis CT reveals a 4 mm kidney stone in the right ureter. What is the cause of his abnormal laboratory findings and recurrent kidney stones?
###Options:
A.  Parathyroid adenoma due to multiple endocrine neoplasm (MEN) 1
B.  Increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secondary to renal cell carcinoma
C.  Abnormal calcium-sensing receptor due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
D.  Milk alkali syndrome due to increased antacid use
E.  Decreased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secondary to renal cell carcinoma

###Answer:",A,"This patient has MEN 1, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malignancies in the pituitary gland, parathyroid gland, and pancreas.

This patient has decreased libido and testosterone, which a possible prolactinoma can best explain. He has a history of acid reflux that is refractory to antacids and omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) that is due to a pancreatic tumor (gastrinoma, or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). The history of recurrent kidney stones is due to hypercalcemia from a parathyroid adenoma.

Parathyroid adenoma causes hyperparathyroidism, which causes symptoms of hypercalcemia, such as excessive thirst, constipation, bone pain, fatigue, depression, and kidney stones.

Laboratory values seen in primary hyperparathyroidism are elevated calcium, low phosphate, and elevated parathyroid hormone",Parathyroid adenoma due to multiple endocrine neoplasm (MEN) 1,Increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secondary to renal cell carcinoma,Abnormal calcium-sensing receptor due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia,Milk alkali syndrome due to increased antacid use,Decreased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secondary to renal cell carcinoma,D,"D

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with milk alkali syndrome, a condition caused by excessive calcium intake, often in the form of calcium carbonate antacids. The syndrome is characterized by hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and kidney stones. The patient's history of taking calcium carbonate antacids for GERD and his laboratory results showing elevated serum calcium and blood in his urine support this diagnosis. The patient's family history of kidney stones and his own history of recurrent stones also suggest a possible underlying metabolic disorder, but the primary cause of his current symptoms is the milk alkali syndrome.",False,model6

diagnosis is

###Options:
A.  Crohns disease
B.  abdominal tb
C.  colorectal carcinoma
D.  ulcerative colitis

###Answer:",D,"The most unlikely diagnosis is:

D) Ulcerative colitis

Explanation:

Given the symptoms described, including cough, fever, weight loss, passage of loose bloody stool, and the presence of multiple masses in the left iliac fossa, ulcerative colitis is the least likely diagnosis.

A) Crohn's disease: Crohn's disease can present with symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss, and sometimes even blood in the stool. It can also cause mass-like lesions in the intestines. Therefore, Crohn's disease remains a possible diagnosis.

B) Abdominal TB (tuberculosis): Abdominal TB can cause multiple masses in the left iliac fossa and presents with symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss, and passage of loose bloody stool. Therefore, abdominal TB is a possible diagnosis.

C) Colorectal carcinoma: Colorectal carcinoma can present with symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss, and passage of loose bloody stool. It can also cause multiple masses in the left iliac fossa. Therefore, colorectal carcinoma remains a possible diagnosis.

D) Ulcerative colitis: Ulcerative colitis typically does not present with masses in the left iliac fossa. The description of multiple masses in the left iliac fossa is more indicative of other conditions such as Crohn's disease, abdominal TB, or colorectal carcinoma.

Thus, the most unlikely diagnosis is ulcerative colitis.






",Crohns disease,abdominal tb,colorectal carcinoma,ulcerative colitis,,C,"C

Rationale: The symptoms mentioned in the question are consistent with gastrointestinal tuberculosis (abdominal TB) or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). However, the presence of multiple masses in the left iliac fossa makes colorectal carcinoma (option C) an unlikely diagnosis. Colorectal carcinoma typically presents as a single mass or lesion, not multiple masses.

His temperature is 39.1 C (102.4 F). He is lethargic but oriented to person, place, and time. On examination, he has severe neck rigidity with limited active and passive range of motion. A lumbar puncture is performed. CSF analysis shows marked neutrophil predominance and 40 mg/dL of glucose. An organism with which of the following features is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?
###Options:
A.  Encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs
B.  Non-encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs
C.  Gram-negative coccobacillus
D.  Gram-positive cocci in a cluster
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"Clinical features like fever, headache, vomiting along with neck rigidity on examination is diagnostic of meningitis.

Low CSF glucose level (<50 mg/dL) along with the neutrophilic predominance is suggestive of bacterial meningitis.

Neisseria meningitis is an encapsulated, gram-negative cocci in pair and is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and adolescents of age group 10-18 years.

Non-encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs are Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhea. Gram-positive cocci in a cluster are staphylococcus aureus. These organisms are rare causes of bacterial meningitis, especially in the age group of 10-18 years.",Encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs,Non-encapsulated gram-negative cocci in pairs,Gram-negative coccobacillus,Gram-positive cocci in a cluster,none,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and CSF analysis are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The presence of gram-negative cocci in pairs in the CSF suggests that the organism responsible is Neisseria meningitidis. This organism is typically encapsulated, which is an important virulence factor. The capsule allows the bacteria to resist phagocytosis and evade the host's immune system.

B.  They have receptors on the cell membrane
C.  They have a slower onset of action than both steroid and thyroid hormones
D.  They are not stored in endocrine-producing glands
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"In general, peptide hormones produce biological effects by binding to receptors on the cell membrane. Peptide hormones are stored in secretion granules in their endocrine-producing cells and have relatively short half-lives because they are not highly bound to plasma proteins. Protein hormones often have a rapid onset of action because, unlike steroid and thyroid hormones, protein synthesis is usually not a prerequisite to produce biological effects.",They have longer half-lives than steroid hormones,They have receptors on the cell membrane,They have a slower onset of action than both steroid and thyroid hormones,They are not stored in endocrine-producing glands,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Peptide or protein hormones are usually synthesized as prohormones and then processed into mature forms. They are typically stored in vesicles within the endocrine-producing glands. Once released, they bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells (cell membrane receptors), triggering a response. They usually have a faster onset of action than steroid hormones, which often require gene transcription and protein synthesis. The half-lives of peptide or protein hormones vary, but they are often shorter than those of steroid hormones. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",True,model6

Her history is significant for major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. She takes sertraline, alprazolam and has regular cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. She has tried illicit drugs but stopped them a year ago. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol occasionally. Vital signs are blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate 58 bpm, respiratory rate 9 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 90% on 5 L O2. Her Glasgow coma score is 8. Her ABG off oxygen is PO2 78 mm Hg, CO2 is 50mm Hg and bicarbonate is 27 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Naloxone
B.  Flumazenil
C.  Intubation and mechanical ventilation
D.  Nasogastric tube placement and activated charcoal
E.  Pyridoxine

###Answer:",C,"The patient likely has a benzodiazepine overdose and given her GCS of 8, her oxygen saturation, and respirations of 9 breaths/min, she needs to be intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain oxygenation. Alcohol also has depressant effects and binge alcohol drinking adds to the effect. Benzodiazepine overdose causes respiratory depression, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypotension, bradycardia, slurred speech, and gait ataxia.

The drug can lead to hemodynamic collapse and respiratory arrest. If the overdose is severe, likely indicated by decreasing O2 sat and GCS of 8 or less, these patients are best ventilated.

The patient needs supportive therapy. Activated charcoal might be given if the patient is fully conscious and presents within 30 minutes of ingestion. Fluid resuscitation should be administered in hypovolemic patients.

Flumazenil may be used in overdose but the current status requires the patient to be mechanically ventilated. Nasogastric tube insertion is not recommended as the patient is not vomiting as it might cause aspiration.",Naloxone,Flumazenil,Intubation and mechanical ventilation,Nasogastric tube placement and activated charcoal,Pyridoxine,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is presenting with altered level of consciousness, bradypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's ABG shows respiratory acidosis, which is likely due to the respiratory depression caused by the combination of lorazepam and alcohol. The patient's Glasgow coma score is 8, indicating a severe impairment of consciousness. The patient's vital signs and ABG suggest that she is at risk of respiratory failure, which makes intubation and mechanical ventilation the most appropriate next step in management. Naloxone may be used to reverse opioid overdose, but it is not indicated in this case. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist, but it is contraindicated in patients who have been taking benzodiazepines regularly, as it can cause seizures. Nasogastric tube placement and activated charcoal may be used later to decontaminate the patient, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

The location of the lesion causing the bleeding is most likely in the ascending colon, as this is the first part of the colon where blood enters after passing through the small intestine. A colonoscopy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and locate the exact site of bleeding.",Ascending colon,Transverse colon,Descending colon,Rectosigmoid,Cecum,E,"E. Cecum

Rationale: 
The patient presents with symptoms of anemia and fatigue, with a microcytic anemia on CBC. The lack of palpable mass or tenderness on abdominal examination, and the absence of blood on digital rectal examination (DRE) suggest that the bleeding is likely to be chronic and slow. The patient's symptoms are not specific to any particular part of the abdomen, and the patient does not have any alarm features such as weight loss or changes in bowel habits. Given the patient's age and the presence of anemia, a colon cancer is a possibility. The most likely location of the lesion given her clinical presentation is the cecum. This is because the cecum is a common location for colon cancers, and bleeding from this location is often not apparent on DRE. Bleeding from the cecum may also not cause any specific abdominal symptoms, which fits with the patient's vague abdominal pain.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Hemolysis
B.  Thrombosis
C.  Septicemia
D.  Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
E.  e) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is (C) Septicemia. Septicemia occurs when bacteria present in donor blood enter the recipient's bloodstream during a transfusion, leading to systemic infection.",Hemolysis,Thrombosis,Septicemia,Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI),e) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO),C,"C

Rationale: A transfusion reaction caused by bacterial contamination of donor blood is known as septicemia. This occurs when bacteria present in the donated blood are transfused into the recipient, causing a severe systemic infection. Hemolysis refers to the breakdown of red blood cells, which can occur due to a transfusion reaction caused by ABO incompatibility. Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot, which is not directly related to transfusion reactions. TRALI is a rare but serious complication of blood transfusion, characterized by acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. TACO is a condition that occurs when a patient receives too much blood too quickly, leading to circulatory overload.",True,model6

His mother says he has experienced a gradual decline in his school performance over the last 6 months and has been acting differently. He recently underwent a drug test which came out negative for any known illicit drugs. He has also experienced weight loss of 11 lb (5 kg) and a gradually decreasing appetite. On examination, tremors are present in both upper extremities, and he is unable to write correctly. The tremors worsen when he is asked to reach for an object. An unsteady, broad-based gait is also observed. His serum transaminases are elevated, and low serum ceruloplasmin is found. The patient is placed on medication to treat his condition. How does this drug help to improve his underlying symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Prevents intestinal absorption of copper
B.  Increases the uptake of copper by the liver and prevents its accumulation in other tissues
C.  Eliminates the high ammonia causing his symptoms
D.  Chelates copper
E.  none

###Answer:",D,"This 16-year-old boy with a decline in school performance, changes in personality (acting differently), tremors, ataxia, elevated liver enzymes, and low ceruloplasmin likely has Wilson disease (also known as hepatolenticular degeneration). Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B, a gene on chromosome 13 that encodes for the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase. The primary source of copper for the body comes from the diet. Dietary copper intake is around 1-2 mg/day, and the daily requirement for copper is 0.75 mg/day; hence proper excretion of copper is crucial to prevent its accumulation in the tissues. Copper is mainly excreted into the bile and then excreted from the body in the feces.

The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase regulates the copper needed by the body and incorporates it into aceruloplasmin (ceruloplasmin without copper) to make ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin is then secreted into the bloodstream, and copper is utilized by the body (eg, iron metabolism). The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase also secretes the excess copper into the bile. In Wilson disease, the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase is dysfunctional, and thus there is deceased incorporation of copper into aceruloplasmin; thus, there will be low blood levels of ceruloplasmin (as in this patient) and decreased secretion of excess copper from the liver into the bile so that the copper will accumulate in the tissues.

In Wilson disease, copper especially accumulates in the liver (causing hepatitis, acute liver failure, cirrhosis), brain (dystonia, dysarthria, tremors, personality changes), the cornea (causing Kayser-Fleischer rings which are brown rings on the cornea due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane of the cornea), joints (arthritis, commonly in the knees), and kidneys (causing Fanconi syndrome). Diagnosis of Wilson disease is by clinical features suggesting Wilson disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit-lamp examination, low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated 24-hour-urine copper, abnormal liver enzymes, and ATP7B mutation analysis.

Treatment of Wilson disease is aimed at removing excess copper by using copper chelators. Penicillamine is the primary chelator used. It has a sulfhydryl group that binds to copper and secretes it through the urine. Trientine is used as a second-line copper chelator. Patients should also be advised to follow a low-copper diet.",Prevents intestinal absorption of copper,Increases the uptake of copper by the liver and prevents its accumulation in other tissues,Eliminates the high ammonia causing his symptoms,Chelates copper,none,D,"D. Chelates copper

Rationale: The patient is suffering from Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability to excrete copper from the body. This leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other organs, causing damage and symptoms such as tremors, difficulty walking, and changes in behavior and cognition. The treatment for Wilson's disease is to remove excess copper from the body. The drug, D-penicillamine, is a chelating agent that binds to copper and other heavy metals, allowing them to be excreted in the urine. This helps to reduce the amount of copper in the body and alleviate symptoms.",True,model6

A.  Henoch-Schönlein purpura
B.  IgA nephropathy
C.  Intussusception
D.  Meckel diverticulum
E.  Hemolytic-uremic syndrome

###Answer:",E,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome predominantly affects children under the age of 4 and is characterized by acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia due to increased platelet utilization, and renal insufficiency resulting from vascular endothelial injury and local fibrin deposition. This condition can lead to ischemic changes, causing renal cortical necrosis, as well as damage to other organs such as the colon, liver, heart, brain, and adrenal glands. Laboratory findings associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome include a low hemoglobin level, decreased platelet count, hypoalbuminemia, and evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear (such as burr cells, helmet cells, and schistocytes). Urinalysis typically reveals hematuria and proteinuria. A significant decline in renal function leads to oliguria and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction, ascites, and central nervous system symptoms like somnolence, convulsions, and coma may also occur.In recent years, infection with verotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 has been identified as a common cause of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. This strain of E. coli is prevalent in cattle and has been associated with outbreaks linked to undercooked contaminated hamburgers, as well as other food items like roast beef, cows milk, and fresh apple cider. It's worth noting that the Coombs test is not positive in this type of hemolytic anemia.Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that typically presents with a petechial-like rash on the lower extremities, although the platelet count remains normal. While microscopic blood in the stool or urine can occur, fever is uncommon, and colicky abdominal pain is a potential symptom.IgA nephropathy may cause hematuria, but it typically doesn't present with the other findings described in the case. Intussusception is a condition seen in children of this age group, but the absence of episodic colicky abdominal pain or emesis makes this diagnosis less likely.Meckel diverticulum can lead to painless bloody stool, but it doesn't usually cause fever or other associated symptoms like anuria.",Henoch-Schönlein purpura,IgA nephropathy,Intussusception,Meckel diverticulum,Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,E,"E.  Hemolytic-uremic syndrome

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The patient's history of gastroenteritis, fever, and bloody diarrhea suggests an infectious etiology, which is common in HUS. The patient's pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, and decreased urination are indicative of acute kidney injury. The laboratory results showing a low hematocrit and platelet count, along with blood and protein in the urine, support the diagnosis of HUS.",True,model6

The discharge is greenish and has a fishy odor. Examination reveals a neonate on supplemental oxygen at 4 liters/min, with nasogastric and foley catheters in place. Her vitals are blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 127 bpm, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min, and temperature 98 °F (37.7 °C). Her cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological examination are unremarkable. A microscopic analysis of the discharge reveals the presence of numerous polymorphonuclear cells. Also, oval-shaped cells with distinct nuclei and terminal flagellum are seen. How did the infant likely acquire the etiologic agent responsible for the discharge?
###Options:
A.  Commensal overgrowth
B.  Urinary catheterization
C.  Perinatal transmission
D.  Fomite transmission
E.  None

###Answer:",C,"This case represents a rare presentation of a common organism. This infant presents with vulvovaginitis and vaginal discharge. Microscopic examination reveals the presence of trichomonads. Infants may acquire an infection during passage through the maternal vaginal canal.

Trichomonas vaginalis may be present asymptomatically in pregnant females. Rare cases have been reported in which the infants acquire infection postnatally via vulvovaginal contact with organisms during the passage. A vulvovaginal discharge is usually present.

Occasionally, trichomonads have been isolated from the pharynx of neonates with severe respiratory infection. Treatment is usually with metronidazole.

Trichomoniasis may rarely be present in neonates. Vigilance and appropriate testing are crucial for an accurate diagnosis.",Commensal overgrowth,Urinary catheterization,Perinatal transmission,Fomite transmission,,C,"C. Perinatal transmission

Rationale: The presence of numerous polymorphonuclear cells and the description of the oval-shaped cells with distinct nuclei and terminal flagellum are consistent with Trichomonas vaginalis. The greenish, fishy-smelling discharge also supports this diagnosis. Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted parasite that is typically acquired through perinatal transmission. The presence of a nasogastric tube and foley catheter in this neonate increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, but they are not the likely source of this infection.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Increased heart rate
B.  Increased systemic vascular resistance
C.  Decreased vascular resistance
D.  Increased stroke volume

A.  Severe depression
B.  Obstetric pelvic trauma
C.  Appendicitis
D.  Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux

###Answer:",B,The correct answer is B. Anorectal physiology assesses pelvic floor function and is useful in suspected pelvic floor dysynergia or obstructed defaecation.,Severe depression,Obstetric pelvic trauma,Appendicitis,Symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux,,B,"B

Rationale: Anorectal physiology (ARP) is a group of tests used to assess the function of the anorectum. It is useful in the assessment of constipation, particularly when there is a history of obstetric pelvic trauma. ARP can help identify defects in the pelvic floor muscles, rectal sensation, and anal sphincter function, which can contribute to constipation. In contrast, severe depression (A) may be associated with constipation, but ARP is not specifically indicated in this scenario.

Reaction to food additive

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of nausea, facial flushing, and chest pressure are consistent with a reaction to a food additive, likely monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is a common additive in Chinese and Thai food, and can cause a range of symptoms including headache, flushing, sweating, and chest pressure. The patient's lack of known allergies, absence of urticaria, and normal oxygen saturation make an allergic reaction or asthma exacerbation less likely. The absence of a palpable neck mass and normal cardiopulmonary examination make carcinoid syndrome less likely. While the patient appears anxious, the presence of physical symptoms makes a panic attack less likely.

###Answer:",A,"The patient has hairy leukoplakia, which shows a histologically normal basal epithelial layer.

The superficial epithelial layer shows hyperkeratinization and hyperparakeratinization.

Hairy leukoplakia is characterized by acanthosis of the upper stratum spinosum/prickle cell layer.

The gene BZLF1 is required to bring about the intracellular transition from the latent state to the productive infectious state. In hairy leukoplakia, the BZLF1 gene is restricted to the cells of the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum.

###Options:
A.  Altered taste on anterior two-thirds of the tongue
B.  Altered taste on posterior one-thirds of the tongue
C.  Facial droop
D.  Abnormal voice pitch
E.  Decreased sensation of the jaw

###Answer:",D,"The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) innervates the posterior third of the tongue and can be damaged in surgeries involving the base of the tongue. It is a mixed nerve that carries afferent sensory and efferent motor information.

Lesions of the glossopharyngeal nerve produce difficulty swallowing, impairment of taste over the posterior one-third of the tongue, impaired sensation over the posterior one-third of the tongue, palate, and pharynx, an absent gag reflex, and dysfunction of the parotid gland.

The branches of the ninth cranial nerve include the tympanic, stylopharyngeal, tonsillar, nerve to carotid sinus, branches to the posterior third of the tongue, lingual branches, and a communicating branch to the vagus nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve contributes to the formation of the pharyngeal plexus along with the vagus nerve.

The 5 functions of the glossopharyngeal nerve are 1) branchial motor, special visceral efferent, supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle and superior constrictor muscle, 2) visceral motor, general visceral efferent, provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland via the otic ganglion, 3) visceral sensory, general visceral afferent, carries visceral sensory information from the carotid body and carotid sinus, 4) general sensory, general somatic afferent, provides general sensory information from the inner surface of the tympanic membrane, upper pharynx, and the posterior one-third of the tongue and 5) visceral afferent, special visceral afferent, provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, including circumvallate papillae. Facial nerve (CN VII) damage would result in facial drooping. Lesions of V-3 would result in a decreased sensation of the jaw.

Rationale: Acute bronchiolitis is a common respiratory illness in infants and young children, characterized by inflammation and constriction of the small airways (bronchioles). The primary cause of acute bronchiolitis in this age group is a viral infection, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is responsible for approximately 70% of cases of bronchiolitis in children under the age of 1 year. Other viruses, such as human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus, can also cause bronchiolitis.

After the fall, a sudden headache developed. The patient describes this headache as the worst of his life. Since the fall, the patient has also experienced vomiting. Given that he may have a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a non-contrast CT of his head is done. The CT is negative. To completely rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a lumbar puncture is performed. If the patient does have a subarachnoid hemorrhage, what finding would most likely be expected from the analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?
###Options:
A.  Xanthochromia
B.  Oligoclonal bands
C.  Elevated protein
D.  Red blood cells, with the greatest concentration in the first tube
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a leakage of blood into the subarachnoid space. The cause is most often traumatic, such as blunt trauma or a fall. The second most common cause is aneurysm rupture.

The great majority of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage experience a sudden onset headache that is described as a ""thunderclap"" or the ""worst headache of my life"".

Diagnosis is usually achieved by a non-contrast CT, but as time since the incident increases, the sensitivity of the CT decreases. To completely rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a lumbar puncture is recommended.

CSF analysis of a patient with a new subarachnoid hemorrhage should show positive erythrocytes evenly in tubes 1 through 4. A traumatic spinal tap should be suspected when the concentration of erythrocytes is greatest in the first tube. Xanthochromia is a yellow-orange discoloration of CSF that may be present if the subarachnoid hemorrhage is subacute. The discoloration is caused by red blood cell degeneration.",Xanthochromia,Oligoclonal bands,Elevated protein,"Red blood cells, with the greatest concentration in the first tube",none,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and the negative CT scan suggest the possibility of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this case, a lumbar puncture is performed to rule out the diagnosis. Xanthochromia, which is a yellow discoloration of the CSF due to the presence of bilirubin, is a key finding in subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is because bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and is formed when red blood cells break down in the CSF. Xanthochromia typically appears within 4-6 hours after the bleed and can persist for up to 2 weeks. It is an important diagnostic finding in subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially when the CT scan is negative.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium. It is prevalent in various regions of Africa and is transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria can lead to symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and, in severe cases, enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), as well as complications such as anemia and cerebral malaria. Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma and primarily affects the liver and intestines.",Schistosomiasis,Filariasis,Malaria,Toxoplasmosis,Trypanosomiasis,C,"C. Malaria

Rationale: Malaria is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease caused by a protozoan parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasite, Plasmodium, multiplies in the liver and then infects red blood cells, leading to their rupture and the release of more parasites into the bloodstream. The symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, as well as abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells. The liver and spleen may become enlarged as they work to filter out the parasites and damaged red blood cells from the bloodstream. Malaria is prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.",True,model6

He suddenly complains of severe chest pain. His blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and his heart rate is 65/min. Auscultation reveals no murmurs or rubs. An ECG reveals sinus rhythm with an acute ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal area. Urgent bedside echocardiography showed anteroseptal, lateral, and apical akinesis, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and severe pericardial effusion. Within 20 minutes he is unconscious with undetectable pulses and blood pressure. What is the most likely cause of the patients sudden decompensation?
###Options:
A.  Free wall rupture
B.  Left ventricular thrombus
C.  Mitral regurgitation
D.  Pericarditis
E.  Ventricular septal rupture

###Answer:",A," The correct answer is A. Myocardial rupture is a sudden postinfarction complication that typically occurs 510 days postmyocardial infarction (peak at 7 days). During this time, the integrity of the cardiac wall is compromised by macrophage and mononuclear infiltration, fibrovascular response, and other inflammatory mediators, as they replace necrotic tissue with scar tissue. Old age, first infarction, and a history of hypertension are risk factors. The clinical manifestations, as depicted here, are a sudden loss of heart rate, blood pressure, and consciousness, while the ECG continues to show a sinus rhythm. Measures to prevent cardiac rupture include the administration of ²blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the avoidance of steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen and indomethacin.",Free wall rupture,Left ventricular thrombus,Mitral regurgitation,Pericarditis,Ventricular septal rupture,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's sudden decompensation, loss of consciousness, and undetectable pulses and blood pressure suggest a catastrophic event. The presence of severe pericardial effusion on echocardiography suggests that the most likely cause is cardiac tamponade due to free wall rupture. This is a common complication of myocardial infarction, especially in the first week after the event. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, as well as the presence of ST-segment elevation on ECG, support this diagnosis.",True,model6

He says he feels well. His medications are metoprolol and lisinopril. His older brother, who was ""seemingly in good health,"" recently underwent emergency repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that had not been diagnosed previously. The patient retired from the military 15 years ago. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 20 years ago. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. Pulse is 72/min and regular, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no organomegaly or tenderness to palpation. The aortic pulsation is estimated at 3 cm in width. A midepigastric bruit is heard.

###Answer:",C,"Given the patient's age, history of smoking, family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the presence of a midepigastric bruit, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is (C) Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen. Duplex ultrasonography is a non-invasive and highly sensitive imaging modality for detecting abdominal aortic aneurysms. It can accurately measure the size of the aneurysm and assess its morphology, guiding further management decisions. In this case, given the concerning family history and the presence of a bruit, duplex ultrasonography would provide valuable information to assess for the presence and size of an AAA.",CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis,Digital angiography of the aorta,Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen,X-ray of the abdomen,No diagnostic imaging is indicated,C,"C

Rationale: 
The patient is at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) because of his age, hypertension, and family history. The abdominal examination suggests an aneurysm because of the palpable aortic pulsation (estimated at 3 cm in width) and the presence of a midepigastric bruit. Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. It is a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive test that can accurately diagnose an AAA. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for detecting an AAA are both greater than 90%. If the ultrasonography is positive, further imaging with CT scan or MRI may be necessary to better define the aneurysm and plan surgical intervention.",True,model6

Traveling by car, she goes over a speed bump, after which the pain starts. Her medical history is significant for recurrent pancreatitis for the past 20 years, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Family history is essential for prostate cancer in her father with metastasis to the lumbar vertebrae. Her medications include metformin, enalapril, losartan, and multivitamins. Vitals are currently within normal limits. Physical examination reveals severe tenderness on palpation of the lower back in the midline. Imaging was done of her lumbar spine to establish a diagnosis. Which of the following information in the patient's medical history is a risk factor for her underlying condition?
###Options:
A.  Family history
B.  Medications
C.  Age
D.  Recurrent episodes of pancreatitis
E.  Diabetes mellitus

###Answer:",D,"This patient has a fracture of her vertebrae, most likely due to vitamin D deficiency. Certain malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatic insufficiency, and cystic fibrosis may lead to vitamin D deficiency. Lower vitamin D intake orally is more prevalent in the elderly population.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia and rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization. This can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Adults under 65 who do not have adequate year-round sun exposure shall consume 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D3 daily to prevent deficiency. Adults over 65 years shall consume 800 to 1000 international units of vitamin D3 daily to avoid deficiency and to reduce the risk of fractures and falls.",Family history,Medications,Age,Recurrent episodes of pancreatitis,Diabetes mellitus,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of vertebral compression fracture. The patient's history of recurrent pancreatitis is a risk factor for vertebral compression fracture because it suggests a history of chronic alcohol abuse, which can lead to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a major risk factor for vertebral compression fractures. The patient's age, family history of prostate cancer, and medications are not directly related to the development of vertebral compression fractures. Diabetes mellitus may contribute to osteoporosis, but it is not as strong a risk factor as a history of chronic pancreatitis.",True,model6

Research on iron therapy in populations at high risk has demonstrated its significant effect on development. Postmenopausal women typically do not face a high risk of anemia. However, elderly individuals, due to inadequate diet, may be at increased risk. To mitigate the incidence of iron deficiency anemia, breastfeeding supplemented with iron-fortified supplements starting at 4 to 6 months, as well as feeding infants iron-fortified formula, can be effective strategies.",An elderly widow living alone,A 10-month-old with a diet of cows milk,A postmenopausal woman,A 14-year-old with heavy periods,A breast-fed one-month-old infant,A,"A. An elderly widow living alone

Rationale: Iron deficiency anemia is more common in the elderly population, particularly those who live alone and have a poor diet. This is because iron absorption decreases with age, and the elderly may have a lower intake of iron-rich foods. Additionally, the elderly may have underlying chronic diseases that can lead to anemia, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic kidney disease. In this scenario, the elderly widow living alone is more susceptible to adverse effects associated with iron deficiency anemia due to her age, potential poor diet, and possible underlying chronic diseases.",False,model6

D.  Omphalocele
E.  Twins

###Answer:",B,"Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is associated with decreased MSAFP levelsFetal anomalies, such as anencephaly, duodenal atresia, and omphalocele result in increased levels of AFP being released into the maternal bloodstream.Twins can also cause an elevated MSAFP level, as there is increased production of AFP in twin pregnancies due to multiple fetuses. ",Anencephaly,Down Syndrome,Duodenal Atresia,Omphalocele,Twins,B,"B

Rationale: 
Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) is a screening test for neural tube defects (NTDs) and other fetal anomalies. A level of 2.8 MOM is considered elevated. The conditions that can cause an elevated MSAFP level include:

* Anencephaly (A): A neural tube defect where the brain and skull do not form properly.
* Omphalocele (D): A defect where the intestines or other organs protrude through the navel.
* Duodenal Atresia (C): A blockage of the small intestine that can cause an elevated MSAFP level.

However, Down Syndrome (B) is not typically associated with an elevated MSAFP level. In fact, women carrying a fetus with Down Syndrome often have lower MSAFP levels.

Twins (E) can also cause an elevated MSAFP level, as there are two fetuses producing alpha-fetoprotein. However, this is not the correct answer in this case, as the question asks for a condition that is NOT an explanation of an abnormal finding.

Rationale: Plasmodium falciparum is associated with the highest parasite burden. It is the most severe form of malaria and is responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths. This is because P. falciparum can infect red blood cells of all ages, leading to a higher parasite load and more severe symptoms. In contrast, P. vivax and P. ovale preferentially infect reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells, and P. malariae tends to infect older red blood cells, resulting in lower parasite burdens.

###Answer:",A,"The injury is to the obturator nerve, which has both a sensory component on the medial thigh and a motor component to adduct the leg. At the time of the lymphadenectomy, the obturator nerve is often exposed. Just below it in the obturator space are many venous plexuses. If bleeding becomes active in this area, efforts to control it could damage the obturator nerve. This same type of nerve injury can also happen in pregnancy secondary to its compression by the fetus against the pelvic floor.

Rationale: The obturator nerve (L2-L4) is responsible for adduction of the thigh. It runs through the pelvic lymph nodes and can be injured during pelvic lymphadenectomy. The symptoms described are consistent with obturator nerve injury. The femoral nerve is responsible for extension of the knee and sensation on the anterior thigh, not adduction of the thigh or sensation on the medial thigh.

E.  E Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

###Answer:",C,"Given the patient's symptoms of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and painless swelling of cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, along with the absence of liver and spleen enlargement, the presentation is consistent with a concern for lymphadenopathy, particularly in the context of the classic triad of symptoms seen in tuberculosis (TB). Chest radiography is the initial step in evaluating patients suspected of having TB",Bone marrow aspiration,Abdominal CT,Chest radiography,Head CT,E Erythrocyte sedimentation rate,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms and signs that are highly suggestive of lymphoma, specifically Hodgkin lymphoma. The initial evaluation should include a chest radiograph to evaluate for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is a common feature of Hodgkin lymphoma. The chest radiograph will also help to determine the extent of the disease and guide further evaluation and staging. The other options are not necessary at this point in the evaluation. Bone marrow aspiration may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it is not the initial test of choice. Abdominal CT may be necessary to evaluate for lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm, but it is not the initial test of choice. Head CT is not necessary unless there are specific symptoms or signs suggesting central nervous system involvement. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated in lymphoma, but it is a nonspecific test and is not necessary in the initial evaluation.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Periodontitis
B.  Gingivitis
C.  Dental caries
D.  Tooth abscess
E.  Dental erosion

###Answer:",D,"A tooth abscess is a painful condition caused by bacterial infection of the tooth's pulp or surrounding tissues, often requiring dental treatment like root canal therapy or extraction.",Periodontitis,Gingivitis,Dental caries,Tooth abscess,Dental erosion,D,"D.  Tooth abscess

Rationale: A tooth abscess is a pocket of pus that forms in the tissues surrounding a tooth as a result of a bacterial infection. It is often characterized by severe pain, swelling, and sensitivity to temperature changes. The infection can spread to other parts of the face and skull, and if left untreated, can lead to serious complications. Periodontitis (A) is a chronic infection of the gums and bone that support the teeth, but it is not typically characterized by severe pain. Gingivitis (B) is a mild form of gum disease that can cause redness and swelling of the gums, but it is not typically associated with severe pain. Dental caries (C) is tooth decay, which can cause pain, but it is not characterized by inflammation and infection of the surrounding tissues. Dental erosion (E) is the wear of tooth enamel, often caused by acid erosion, and is not typically associated with pain or inflammation.",True,model6

His parents are worried as he also looks considerably pale. After some tests, it is found that he has low levels of plasma citrulline and an increased concentration of orotic acid in urine. There is no megaloblastic anemia. What is the most likely diagnosis? 
###Options:
A.  Maple syrup urine disease
B.  Phenylketonuria
C.  Wilsons disease
D.  Ornithine transcarbamylase  deficiency
E.  Hereditary orotic aciduria

###Answer:",D,"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an X-linked mitochondrial disorder of the urea cycle. It leads to accumulation of orotic acid due to the impairment of the second step in the urea cycle, where carbamoyl phosphate is converted into citrulline. This also explains the decreased concentrations of citrulline in the plasma. Due to the X-linked nature, it is more common in males.",Maple syrup urine disease,Phenylketonuria,Wilsons disease,Ornithine transcarbamylase  deficiency,Hereditary orotic aciduria,D,"D. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency

Rationale: 
The symptoms presented by the boy, such as nausea, vomiting, and paleness, suggest a urea cycle disorder. The low levels of plasma citrulline and increased concentration of orotic acid in urine point towards ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Ornithine transcarbamylase is an enzyme involved in the urea cycle that converts citrulline to arginine. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of ammonia, which can cause nausea and vomiting. The increased concentration of orotic acid in urine is a characteristic feature of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, as carbamoyl phosphate, which is not utilized in the urea cycle, is diverted to the synthesis of orotic acid.",True,model6

He reports a history of trauma to the leg two weeks ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Cellulitis
B.  Varicose veins
C.  Lymphatic filariasis
D.  . Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
E.  Osteomyelitis

###Answer:",C,The patient's history of trauma to the leg and his residence in a region endemic for lymphatic filariasis puts him at a higher risk of developing lymphatic filariasis.,Cellulitis,Varicose veins,Lymphatic filariasis,. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT),Osteomyelitis,D,"D

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of a swollen leg, particularly after a recent history of trauma, are most consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's age and medical history also increase his risk for developing DVT. While cellulitis (A) can cause swelling and redness of the leg, it is typically associated with fever and warmth of the affected area, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Varicose veins (B) can cause swelling, but it is usually bilateral and not typically associated with trauma. Lymphatic filariasis (C) is a parasitic infection that can cause swelling of the legs, but it is typically bilateral and not associated with trauma. Osteomyelitis (E) is an infection of the bone and would not typically cause swelling of the entire leg.",False,model6

###Answer:",C,Pubertal effect is commonly termed pubarche which begins to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years.,Thelarche,Menarche,Pubarche,Skeletal growth,Vaginal cornification,C,"C

Rationale: Pubarche, which is the development of pubic hair, is a result of the production of adrenal androgens. It is not dependent on ovarian estrogen production and would occur even in the absence of ovarian estrogen production. Thelarche (breast development) and vaginal cornification are both dependent on estrogen production, and menarche (first menstrual period) is dependent on both estrogen and progesterone production. Skeletal growth is influenced by multiple hormones, including estrogen, growth hormone, and thyroid hormone.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Simple vulvectomy
B.  Radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy
C.  Chemotherapy
D.  Radiation therapy
E.  Radical vulvectomy

###Answer:",B,"Invasive vulvar carcinoma in women typically involves surgical treatment. For lesions that are unilateral, not associated with fixed or ulcerated inguinal lymph nodes, and do not affect adjacent structures like the urethra, vagina, anus, or rectum, the standard treatment involves radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. If inguinal lymph nodes exhibit metastatic disease, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is typically performed. While radiation therapy isn't commonly used in the management of early-stage vulvar carcinoma, it may be considered as an alternative to pelvic exenteration with radical vulvectomy in cases of locally advanced carcinoma.",Simple vulvectomy,Radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy,Chemotherapy,Radiation therapy,Radical vulvectomy,B,"B

Rationale: For a unilateral invasive vulvar carcinoma measuring 2 cm in diameter, without evidence of lymph node spread, the appropriate initial management is radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. This is because the tumor is still localized to the vulva and the lymph nodes are not involved. Radical vulvectomy involves removing the entire vulva, including the labia, clitoris, and perineum, while bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy involves removing the lymph nodes in both groins.

Rationale: IgG is the only immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta, providing passive immunity to the fetus. This is important for protecting the fetus from infections during fetal development and for several months after birth. While IgM can be produced by the fetus in response to infections, it does not cross the placenta from the mother. IgA is found in breast milk and provides protection to the infant during breastfeeding, but it does not cross the placenta.

###Answer:",D,"Dacrocytes (D), more commonly known as tear-drop cells, are strongly indicative of myelofibrosis. Sickle cells (B) occur due to homozygous haemoglobin S which causes cell sickling on polymerization. Schistocytes (A), more commonly known as fragmented red cells, can be seen in a number of conditions such as haemolytic anaemia or disseminated intracascular coagulation. Spherocytes (C) are commonly seen in haemolytic anaemia or in congenital disease, such as hereditary spherocytosis. Target cells (E) can be indicative of obstructive jaundice, liver disease, haemoglobinopathies and hyposplenism.",Schistocytosis,Sickle cells,Spherocytes,Dacrocytes,Target cells,D,"D. Dacrocytes

Rationale: The patient's presentation is consistent with myelofibrosis, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by fibrosis of the bone marrow, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver. The peripheral blood smear would likely show features of extramedullary hematopoiesis, including dacrocytes (tear-drop shaped red blood cells), nucleated red blood cells, and immature white blood cells.

Rationale: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by the excessive activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels. Laboratory findings in DIC typically include:

* Prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to consumption of coagulation factors
* Decreased platelet count due to platelet consumption
* Decreased fibrinogen level due to consumption
* Elevated D-dimer level, which is a breakdown product of fibrin and indicates the presence of fibrinolysis
* Elevated levels of fibrin degradation products (FDPs)

clinical problems?
 


###Options:
A.  Infection
B.  Airway obstruction
C.  Hemorrhage
D.  Malignant degeneration
E.  Pain

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is a. Infection.

Branchial cleft remnants are congenital anomalies that can persist as cysts, sinuses, or fistulas due to incomplete closure of the branchial clefts during embryonic development. These remnants can become sites for the accumulation of debris and colonization by bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. Infection is the most common clinical problem associated with branchial cleft remnants, presenting as localized swelling, erythema, tenderness, and sometimes purulent drainage.

Options b, c, d, and e are less commonly associated with branchial cleft remnants:

b. Airway obstruction: While large branchial cleft cysts or fistulas may compress adjacent structures, leading to airway obstruction in rare cases, it is not the most common presentation.

c. Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage from branchial cleft remnants is uncommon and typically occurs secondary to trauma or inflammation rather than being a primary clinical problem.

d. Malignant degeneration: Malignant transformation of branchial cleft remnants is rare but can occur, typically presenting as a painless mass rather than infection.

e. Pain: Pain may occur if there is acute infection or inflammation of the branchial cleft remnant, but it is not the most common presentation.

Therefore, the most common clinical problem associated with branchial cleft remnants is infection, making option a the correct answer.",Infection,Airway obstruction,Hemorrhage,Malignant degeneration,Pain,A,"A

Rationale: Branchial cleft remnants are congenital anomalies that result from the incomplete formation or fusion of the branchial clefts during embryonic development. They can present with various clinical problems, but the most common presentation is infection (Option A). The remnants can become infected, leading to abscess formation, which may require surgical drainage. Other options, such as airway obstruction (Option B), hemorrhage (Option C), and malignant degeneration (Option D), are less common presentations of branchial cleft remnants. Pain (Option E) may be a symptom of an infected branchial cleft remnant, but it is not a primary clinical problem associated with these anomalies.",True,model6

D.  Recombinant activated factor VII
E.  None

###Answer:",B,"Prothrombin complex concentrates (PPCs) have fewer complications than fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

PCCs do not require cross-matching and can be reconstituted and administered rapidly.

PCCs contain clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and can rapidly normalize INR.

Recombinant activated factor VII does not replace all clotting factors.",Fresh frozen plasma,Prothrombin complex concentrates,Platelet concentrates,Recombinant activated factor VII,,B,"B

Rationale: 
Warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Vitamin K can reverse warfarin's effect by promoting the synthesis of these factors. However, this process takes several hours. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains these factors and can rapidly reverse warfarin's effect, but it requires large volumes and may cause volume overload. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are a concentrated source of these factors and can rapidly reverse warfarin's effect with a smaller volume. They are the preferred choice for urgent reversal of warfarin's effect, especially in patients with life-threatening bleeding, such as this patient with an intracranial hemorrhage. Recombinant activated factor VII is not typically used for warfarin reversal and is usually reserved for patients with hemophilia or Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Platelet concentrates are not relevant to warfarin reversal.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most appropriate next step in management is to perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery. PCI has been shown to be superior to thrombolytic therapy in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with STEMI. Aspirin, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and morphine are all important adjunctive therapies, but they should not delay the performance of PCI.

E.  Right lower quadrant peritoneal findings

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is  a, b, c, d, e.

Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract that results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct during embryonic development. It can present with various signs and symptoms, including:

a. Hemorrhage: Meckel's diverticulum can contain gastric mucosa, which may produce acid and cause ulceration, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.

b. Intussusception: Meckel's diverticulum can act as a lead point for intussusception, a condition where a segment of the intestine invaginates into the adjacent segment.

c. Volvulus: Meckel's diverticulum may undergo volvulus, where it twists upon itself, potentially leading to obstruction and ischemia of the involved segment.

d. Patent omphalomesenteric duct: Meckel's diverticulum represents a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which can remain patent and cause complications such as fistula formation or discharge from the umbilicus.

e. Right lower quadrant peritoneal findings: In cases of Meckel's diverticulum complication, such as perforation or inflammation, patients may present with peritonitis or localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

###Options:
A.  Abdominal x-ray
B.  Abdominal scan
C.  Serology markers for celiac disease
D.  Physical exam
E.  Ask more questions about possible abuse

###Answer:",D,"DSM -5 defines Encopresis or fecal incontinence as involuntary passing of stool into inappropriate places such as the underwear in children older than four years of age. There is at least one episode of encopresis each month for the last three months. These behaviors are not related to any other medical condition or substance-related or medications( laxative use/abuse).

The most common types of encopresis are; 1. Retentive encopresis - which is due to constipation and overflow incontinence.2. Non-retentive encopresis - inappropriate soiling without evidence of fecal constipation and retention.

Therefore, a thorough physical exam is necessary to investigate for fecal impaction.

While abdomen x-ray might confirm fecal impaction and overflow encopresis, it is not necessary most of the time because history and physical exam are adequate.

D.  Beta-blockers
E.  alpha-blockers

###Answer:",B,"Prinzmetal or variant angina is severe chest pain due to spasms of an epicardial coronary artery. It is more often diagnosed in younger patients who smoke cigarettes.

Calcium channel blockers play an important role in the management of vasospastic angina. They are the first-line treatment due to a vasodilation effect in the coronary vasculature. Calcium antagonists are effective in alleviating symptoms in 90% of the patients. Moreover, one study demonstrated that the use of calcium channel blocker therapy was an independent predictor of myocardial infarct-free survival in vasospastic angina.

The use of a long-acting calcium antagonist is recommended, preferably at bedtime. A high dose of a long-acting calcium antagonist like diltiazem, amlodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil is recommended, and titration should be done on an individual basis with adequate response and minimal side effects.

Beta-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of vasospastic angina due to beta-2 adrenergic receptor blockade that increases the vasoconstriction in the arteries generating worsening of symptoms of vasospasm.",Benzodiazepine therapy,Calcium channel blockers,Daily exercise and weight reduction,Beta-blockers,alpha-blockers,B,"B

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with Prinzmetal's angina, which is a rare form of angina that occurs at rest, often at night, and is caused by focal spasm of the coronary arteries. Calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice for Prinzmetal's angina, as they can help relieve coronary vasospasm.

Rationale: 

The patient is a 21-year-old woman who was raped a week ago and now presents with symptoms. She has tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia. Given her history of rape and the presence of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs), it is likely that she may have contracted other STIs as well. Herpes simplex is a common STI that can be transmitted through sexual contact, including rape. Therefore, it is possible that she may test positive for herpes simplex.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's history of rape and STIs. Syphilis is another STI, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or history. Candida is a fungal infection that can cause vaginal infections, but it is not typically associated with rape or STIs.

###Answer:",D,"Although the concept of ERAS was originally started in colorectal surgery it is now usedacross all surgical specialties. Enhanced recovery, also known as Rapid or AcceleratedRecovery or Fast Track surgery, is an evidence-based innovative approach to the preoperative,intraoperative and postoperative care of patients undergoing elective surgery. It improvespatient outcomes by speeding postoperative recovery, thus reducing the stress responsefollowing surgery.First developed in Copenhagen by Professor Henrik Kehlet in 1997, it has been used in theUnited Kingdom since 2002. The concept optimises rehabilitation following major surgerywith better outcomes and reduced hospital stay enabling faster postoperative recovery. Thisis achieved through patient engagement by shared decision making. This results in improvedclinical outcomes and a better patient experience from a shorter hospital stay.

C.  (C)	Müllerian ducts to regress
D.  (D)	the primitive vaginal tube to regress
E.  (E)	the gonadal ridge to differentiate into a testis

###Answer:",E,Stimulation by testosterone causes the male mesonephric ducts (Wolffian ducts) to differentiate. Anti-Müllerian factor (MIF) produced by the testes causes the Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts to regress. Absence of these hormones causes the Müllerian ducts to persist and develop independently of the presence of estrogen. Genital sex is therefore determined by the presence or absence of functional androgen and MIF.,(A)	paramesonephros to differentiate into the proximal urinary duct system,(B)	Wolffian ducts to develop,(C)	Müllerian ducts to regress,(D)	the primitive vaginal tube to regress,(E)	the gonadal ridge to differentiate into a testis,B,"B

Rationale: The presence of androgens during embryonic development can cause the Wolffian ducts to develop into male reproductive structures, such as the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. This is a normal process in male development, but in a female fetus, exposure to androgens can lead to virilization of the reproductive system.",False,model6

The parents report low-grade fever for the last three days. He also refuses to eat to drink milk and has no appetite. Fever is recorded as 100 F, blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg, and the pulse is 100/min. On chest examination, there is inspiratory stridor. He is bottle-fed and has had many missed vaccination appointments in the past. He was born in the hospital via C-section and had normal development after birth. A complete blood count is ordered and shows leucocytosis. A lateral neck x-ray reveals a characteristic cherry-shaped swelling. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Croup
B.  Epiglottitis
C.  Tonsillitis
D.  Foreign body obstruction
E.  pharygitis

###Answer:",B,"This patient has epiglottitis. It is very common in children 1-3 years of age and is due to Haemophilus influenza type b in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children.

The affected child has a toxic/pale/cyanotic look and adopts a tripod position in an attempt to open the airway fully. On examination, there is fever (57%), stridor (81%), respiratory distress (78%), sore throat (65%), drooling (42%), painful swallowing (49%), tender neck (65%), altered voice (33%), cervical adenopathy (39%), and sometimes cough.

CBC may or may not show leucocytosis. Later neck x-ray shows 'thumb sign' or a 'cherry-shaped' epiglottic swelling.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of stridor, refusal to eat or drink, and fever suggest an upper airway obstruction. The lateral neck x-ray showing a cherry-shaped swelling is consistent with epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is an acute infection of the epiglottis, which can cause sudden onset of stridor, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. The patient's history of missed vaccinations and being bottle-fed may have increased his risk for developing epiglottitis. In contrast, croup typically presents with a barking cough and a steeple sign on x-ray, while tonsillitis and pharyngitis are typically associated with exudates and swollen tonsils. Foreign body obstruction would not typically present with fever and would have a different x-ray appearance.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Intravenous antihypertensive agents
B.  Observation and regular blood pressure monitoring
C.  Oral antihypertensive agents
D.  Lifestyle modifications
E.  Immediate hospital admission

###Answer:",C,"In cases of hypertensive urgency without acute end-organ damage, oral antihypertensive agents are often used for gradual blood pressure reduction.",Intravenous antihypertensive agents,Observation and regular blood pressure monitoring,Oral antihypertensive agents,Lifestyle modifications,Immediate hospital admission,C,"C. Oral antihypertensive agents

Rationale: Hypertensive urgency is a situation where blood pressure is severely elevated, but there is no evidence of acute target organ damage. In such cases, the goal is to gradually reduce blood pressure over a period of hours to minimize the risk of complications. Oral antihypertensive agents are the most appropriate initial management in this scenario, as they can help to gradually reduce blood pressure. Intravenous antihypertensive agents are usually reserved for hypertensive emergencies, where there is evidence of acute target organ damage. Observation and regular blood pressure monitoring may not be sufficient, as the patient's blood pressure needs to be reduced. Lifestyle modifications are important for long-term blood pressure control, but are not sufficient as an initial management strategy in this scenario.

He describes being jarred in an elevator 5 days earlier and sustaining a large bruise on his right flank. That evening, he had trouble sleeping from the pain, but finally managed to rest while sitting in a recliner. Over the past 5 days he has had progressive shortness of breath; originally it was related to exertion, but it now occurs at rest. He continues to sleep in the recliner for comfort. He does not smoke. On physical examination, an ecchymosis is evident on his right flank. He is mildly dyspneic with conversation. BMI is 25.7.

D.  Pleural effusion
E.  Chylothorax

###Answer:",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is hemothorax. The patient's history of sustaining a large bruise on his right flank after being jarred in an elevator suggests trauma to the chest, which can cause hemothorax. The progressive shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest, and dullness to percussion in the lungs are consistent with hemothorax. The presence of tachycardia and mild dyspnea also support this diagnosis. The absence of acute ST- or T-wave changes on the electrocardiogram rules out other cardiac causes.",Pneumonia,Pulmonary Embolism,Hemothorax,Pleural effusion,Chylothorax,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, ecchymosis on his right flank, and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest suggest a diagnosis of hemothorax. The patient's history of trauma from the elevator accident and bruising on his right flank suggests that he may have sustained a rib fracture or other injury that led to bleeding in the chest cavity. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a hemothorax, which is a collection of blood in the pleural space. The patient's physical examination findings, including dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest, are also consistent with a hemothorax. While pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and chylothorax are all possibilities, the patient's history and physical examination findings make hemothorax the most likely diagnosis.",True,model6

Physical examination was unremarkable except for a mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa. A complete blood count (CBC) showed leukocytosis with the left shift. Urine HCG is negative. Which of the following is the next best step in managing this patient?
###Options:
A.  Ultrasound abdomen
B.  Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen
C.  Plain CT abdomen
D.  Proceed for laparoscopic appendectomy
E.  MRI of abdomen

###Answer:",A,"This patient is most likely suffering from acute appendicitis with the features suggestive of this diagnosis, such as peri-umbilical pain that later localizes towards the right lower quadrant. Examination findings of fever, tachycardia, and mild right iliac fossa tenderness are usually diagnostic. Moreover, a complete blood count revealing leukocytosis with a left shift is also used to diagnose acute appendicitis.

A normal appendix usually cannot be seen with ultrasonography (USG). When appendicitis occurs, the ultrasonogram typically depicts a noncompressible tubular structure of 7 to 9 mm in diameter, lacking peristalsis. A peri-appendiceal fluid collection may also be appreciated.

A combined approach of using transvaginal ultrasound along with abdominal ultrasound is preferred for the evaluation of acute appendicitis in women of childbearing age.

Because of the considerable radiation exposure involved in CT abdomen, USG abdomen is always the best initial test for evaluating acute appendicitis. A CT scan should be avoided in women of childbearing age as far as possible.",Ultrasound abdomen,Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen,Plain CT abdomen,Proceed for laparoscopic appendectomy,MRI of abdomen,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, including periumbilical pain that has localized to the right lower quadrant, fever, and leukocytosis.

A.  Insulin
B.  Glucagon
C.  Cortisol
D.  Growth hormone
E.  Thyroxine

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is option (B) Glucagon.

Rationale: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are low, glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in the liver, a process known as glycogenolysis. This increases blood glucose levels, helping to maintain homeostasis.

A. Spontaneous abortion
Explanation
The most likely cause of the symptoms described in the question is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage. Vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps are common signs of a miscarriage, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This occurs when the pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week.

Rationale: The most common cause of vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps in the first trimester is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage. The symptoms described are consistent with a threatened abortion, which is a common complication of early pregnancy. Abruptio placenta is more likely to occur in the second and third trimesters, and placenta previa typically presents with painless bleeding in the second and third trimesters.

A history of present illness reveals the onset of ulcerative skin lesions over the past 2 weeks and an episode of the ""flu"" 2 weeks ago. His medical history is significant for HIV infection diagnosed 3 months ago and treated with antiretrovirals. His vital signs are blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate 75 bpm, respiratory rate 15 breaths/min, and temperature 98 °F 36.6 °C). His physical examination reveals multiple papulo-nodular lesions with overlying ulceration. Some lesions are covered by a limpet-like crust. His laboratory tests reveal a WBC count of 5,000/¼L, hemoglobin of 12 g/dL, platelet count of 150,000/¼L, serum ALT 50 IU/L, serum AST 45 IU/L, serum CRP 25 mg/L, and serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL. His serology tests are anti-HIV positive, anti-CMV IgM negative, anti-CMV IgG positive, anti-HCV negative, anti-VZV IgM negative, anti-VZV IgG positive, VDRL positive, anti-toxoplasma negative. A biopsy of the ulcerative lesions reveals dermal capillary congestion and perivascular plasmacytic infiltrate. Which of the following is an appropriate treatment?
###Options:
A.  Squalene epoxidase inhibitor
B.  Viral polymerase inhibitor
C.  Peptidyl transferase inhibitor
D.  Beta-lactam (Transpeptidase inhibitor)
E.  None

###Answer:",D,"This patient has presented with ulcerative skin lesions. The positive VDRL serology and finding of plasma cells on biopsy make this a diagnosis of malignant syphilis. Individuals with HIV infection have a higher probability of developing malignant syphilis.

Treponema pallidum is treated with benzathine penicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic that works as a bacterial transpeptidase inhibitor. The usual dose is 2.4 million units by intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin. A single dose is usually sufficient to achieve a cure. RPR or VDRL tests can be measured subsequently to show declining titers. Alternative agents include oral doxycycline or azithromycin.

Squalene epoxidase inhibitors are used in treating high cholesterol and fungal infections. Bacterial peptidyl transferase inhibition is the mechanism of action for the antibiotic chloramphenicol, which is not used for syphilis.

A paradoxical worsening of the rash may be observed initially. Fungal diseases such as blastomycosis can cause disseminated infections that can cause diffuse ulcerations, and treatment is with azoles. Disseminate cytomegalovirus can cause ulcerative lesions in immunosuppressed patients and are treated with viral polymerase inhibitors.

Rationale: The patient is HIV positive and has a skin rash characterized by papulo-nodular lesions with ulceration. The rash is likely due to secondary syphilis, given the positive VDRL test and the histopathological findings. The patient should receive treatment for syphilis. Squalene epoxidase inhibitors are a class of antifungal medications that are not indicated for the treatment of syphilis. Viral polymerase inhibitors are used to treat viral infections, such as HIV, but are not effective against syphilis.

###Options:
A.  Ascites
B.  Basal crepitations
C.  Dependant edema
D.  Engorged neck veins
E.  Fourth heart sound

###Answer:",B,Ref: Heart Failure (Page 545) Davidsons Principles and  Practice of Medicine.,Ascites,Basal crepitations,Dependant edema,Engorged neck veins,Fourth heart sound,B,"B

Rationale: 
Left heart failure typically presents with symptoms related to the lungs, such as shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue. The physical examination findings in left heart failure may include basal crepitations, which are fine crackles heard at the lung bases due to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli. This is because the left ventricle is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary veins and subsequent fluid leakage into the alveoli. The other options are not specific to left heart failure. Ascites is more commonly associated with right heart failure or liver disease, dependent edema is a non-specific finding, and engorged neck veins are typically seen in right heart failure. A fourth heart sound can be seen in various conditions, including left heart failure, but it is not a specific indicator.",True,model6

Epinephrine (adrenaline)

Rationale: Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in the body's ""fight or flight"" response to stress. It increases heart rate, dilates airways, and mobilizes energy reserves by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver. This allows the body to respond quickly to threats or stressors.

She reports little vaginal discharge, but rather a 1-year history of progressively worsening vulvar discomfort that has escalated to pain sufficient to preclude intercourse and tampon use. Inspection of the vulva demonstrates focal inflammation, punctation, and ulceration of the perineal and vaginal epithelium. An attempt to perform a bimanual examination of the pelvic organs reveals intense pain and tenderness at the posterior introitus and vestibule.

###Answer:",A,"The patient's symptoms, including vulvar discomfort, pain during intercourse, and tenderness at the posterior introitus and vestibule, are consistent with a diagnosis of vulvodynia. Vulvodynia is a chronic condition characterized by vulvar pain or discomfort without an identifiable cause. The management of vulvodynia typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including topical anesthetics to provide symptomatic relief and antidepressant treatment to address any underlying psychological factors contributing to the pain. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this lesion would be topical anesthetics and antidepressant treatment.",Topical anesthetics and antidepressant treatment,Reduction of dietary oxylates,excisional biopsy of the lesions,Interferon injections of the vaginal introitus,Electrodessication of the lesions  Correct Answer,A,"A.  Topical anesthetics and antidepressant treatment

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS). VVS is a chronic condition characterized by vulvar pain, burning, and discomfort, often exacerbated by touch or pressure. The etiology is unknown, but it is thought to be related to chronic inflammation, nerve damage, and psychological factors. Management of VVS is focused on symptom relief and pain management. Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine, can be applied to the affected area to reduce pain and discomfort. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been shown to be effective in reducing vulvar pain. Other options, such as excisional biopsy, interferon injections, and electrodessication, are not indicated for the management of VVS. Reduction of dietary oxylates may be beneficial in patients with interstitial cystitis, but it is not specifically indicated for VVS.",True,model6

D.  Inflammatory demyelination syndrome
E.  Concurrent vitamin B9 deficiency

###Answer:",A,"In patients with vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia, the treatment of megaloblastic anemia with folate alone may cause a progression in neurologic symptoms.

Hematologic improvement may occur in patients receiving folate therapy who also have a vitamin B12 deficiency. Thus, it is especially important to be sure that there is no other underlying cause of the patient's megaloblastic anemia.

As lab work may be improving, neurologic deficits may be worsening, and can even become permanent. IV folinic acid is FDA approved for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia in patients who do not have a vitamin B12 deficiency and in whom oral therapy is not possible.

In megaloblastic anemia without concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency, lab work showing hematologic improvement is generally indicative of efficacy.",Concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency,Tumor lysis syndrome,Global cerebral hypoperfusion,Inflammatory demyelination syndrome,Concurrent vitamin B9 deficiency,A,"A. Concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of confusion, ataxia, and bilateral lower extremity numbness are consistent with a vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's vegan diet puts her at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, as the primary sources of vitamin B12 are animal products. The fact that she was recently treated with folinic acid for megaloblastic anemia secondary to folate deficiency is also relevant, as folinic acid can mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency but not its neurological symptoms. This is because folinic acid can be used to synthesize DNA, but it cannot be used to synthesize methionine, which is necessary for the maintenance of the nervous system. Therefore, the patient's neurological symptoms may have worsened after receiving folinic acid, as the hematological symptoms improved but the neurological symptoms continued to progress.",True,model6

Rationale: The absence of blood vessels is a key feature that distinguishes complete hydatidiform mole from normal placenta. Complete moles lack blood vessels and have a characteristic avascular pattern, whereas normal placentas have well-developed blood vessels.

M. pneumoniae lacks a cell wall and is fastidious; therefore, gram stains and cultures are not useful for the diagnosis of these organisms.

Hemolysis is found in the majority of patients with pneumonia and causes a positive Coomb test and an elevated reticulocyte count. Cold agglutinin titers are elevated in more than 50% of patients with mycoplasma disease.

Hyponatremia is characteristic of Legionella pneumonia. Patients with Legionella pneumonia most often have a history of exposure to a contaminated water source. Elevated serum IgE levels occur in bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, usually in patients with asthma.",Elevated transaminases,Hyponatremia,Elevated serum IgE,Presence of cold agglutinins,Elevated serum IgG,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings are consistent with atypical pneumonia, and the requirement for cholesterol-enriched medium suggests that the organism is Chlamydia pneumoniae. C. pneumoniae is known to cause mild to moderate pneumonia, and hyponatremia is a common laboratory finding in patients with this infection.",False,model6

He was having dinner at a nearby restaurant and suddenly felt intense pain. He has never had this type of pain before, although he does report having periodic abdominal pain for several months. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. He denies the use of alcohol or any illicit drugs. He has no allergies. His vital signs are heart rate 120 bpm, blood pressure 100/80 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2L of oxygen via nasal cannula. A physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal pain with rebound and guarding. Which of the following pathologies can present with such findings?
###Options:
A.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
B.  Boerhaave's syndrome
C.  Peptic ulcer
D.  Chronic pancreatitis
E.  Liver disease

###Answer:",C,"A perforation secondary to a peptic ulcer should be high on the differential in any patient that has chronic abdominal pain, which presents with a sudden onset of acute abdominal pain with peritoneal signs.",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),Boerhaave's syndrome,Peptic ulcer,Chronic pancreatitis,Liver disease,C,"C. Peptic ulcer

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute abdomen, which is characterized by sudden and severe abdominal pain. The presence of rebound and guarding on physical examination suggests peritoneal irritation, which can occur with perforation of a peptic ulcer. Peptic ulcer disease can cause chronic abdominal pain, which is consistent with the patient's history. While the other options can cause abdominal pain, they are less likely to present with an acute abdomen and peritoneal irritation. GERD typically presents with retrosternal chest pain or burning, and Boerhaave's syndrome is a rare condition that occurs with esophageal rupture. Chronic pancreatitis typically presents with chronic abdominal pain, but it is less likely to cause an acute abdomen. Liver disease can cause abdominal pain, but it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as jaundice or ascites.",True,model6

The remaining CSF reports are awaited. Which of the following evaluations is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Brain biopsy
B.  MRI brain with diffusion-weighted images and FLAIR sequences
C.  Clinical symptoms and signs
D.  CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
E.  CT brain

###Answer:",D,"The most sensitive and specific way to diagnose Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is to do an HSV PCR in CSF. HSV PCR has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94 to 100%. HSV PCR could be false negative in the initial 72 hours and needs to be repeated after 3 to 7 days if the suspicion is high. RBCs in the CSF can also give a false negative test.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be type 1 or type 2. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of life-threatening sporadic encephalitis worldwide. It causes encephalitis in adults and children beyond the neonatal age. Neonatal herpes encephalitis could be either due to type 1 or type 2, the latter being more common.

Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults. A high index of suspicion, rapid diagnostic workups, and early diagnosis with early initiation of acyclovir can further improve morbidity and mortality.

Clinical signs and symptoms are highly non-specific. Immunocompromised or elderly can have atypical or subtle presentations. Cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes could be easily misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. Classic radiologic features that have been described include asymmetric involvement of the limbic system, abnormalities in the inferior medial temporal lobes and inferolateral frontal lobes, and the insular cortices. Diffusion-weighted MRI with flair sequences is 90% sensitive in detecting changes in HSE (herpes simplex encephalitis). CT can detect changes only in half to two-thirds of patients. Brain biopsy is rarely performed nowadays, and considerations include undiagnosed brain pathology where the patient is further deteriorating or not responding to antiviral treatment despite a positive HSV PCR.",Brain biopsy,MRI brain with diffusion-weighted images and FLAIR sequences,Clinical symptoms and signs,CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR),CT brain,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's presentation with confusion, low-grade fever, and CSF findings (RBCs 150 microL, WBCs 300/microL, protein 136 mg/dL, and glucose 50 mg/dL) suggests the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. The gold standard for diagnosing HSV encephalitis is a brain biopsy. However, due to its invasive nature, it is not commonly performed. Instead, the diagnosis is often made based on clinical symptoms and signs, CSF PCR for HSV DNA, and neuroimaging findings. In this case, the CSF PCR for HSV DNA would be the next best step to confirm the diagnosis.",False,model6

Rationale: 

The patient's symptoms are consistent with reactive arthritis, which is a form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, often a sexually transmitted infection. The current consensus is that antibiotics are not recommended in most cases of reactive arthritis, as they do not alter the course of the disease. This is because the arthritis is a reactive process, and the infecting organism has already been cleared from the body. Therefore, antibiotics are not effective in treating the arthritis itself. However, antibiotics may be necessary to treat any underlying infections, such as chlamydia. In this case, the patient has already been treated for a sexually transmitted disease 6 weeks ago, so antibiotics are unlikely to be of benefit in treating the arthritis.",True,model6

A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency department with complaints of nausea and vomiting. She has also been experiencing abdominal pain. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is on insulin therapy. On presentation, she is afebrile, has a pulse rate of 92 bpm, a blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. The physical examination does not reveal any abnormal findings. Her blood sugar level is 24 mmol/L (432 mg/dl) (normal: up to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), 2 hours postprandial. She has hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl, a total leukocyte count of 7000/mm3, and a platelet count of 300,000/mm3. A urine dipstick test shows ketonuria of 4+. The renal function tests include urea levels of 10 mg/dl (normal 7 to 20 mg/dl) and a creatinine of 1.0 mg/dl (normal 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dl). Serum electrolytes show a sodium level of 135 mmol/L (normal: 135-145 mmol/L), a potassium of 3.5 mmol/L (normal: 3.5-5 mmol/L), and a chloride of 97 mmol/L (normal: 95 -105 mmol/L). The electrocardiography does not reveal any abnormal findings. A serum amylase level of 40 U/L (normal: 30-125 U/L) is noted. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following would be the next step in evaluating this patient?
###Options:
A.  Arterial blood gas
B.  Abdominal ultrasonography
C.  ²-hydroxybutyrate level
D.  Serum lactate level measurement
E.  Chest x-ray

###Answer:",A,"Diabetic ketoacidosis is one of the complications of diabetes. On an arterial blood gas analysis, the typical picture is of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The diagnosis is based on the presence of hyperglycemia (greater than 11 mmol/L), acidemia (venous pH less than 7.3, or bicarbonate less than 15 mmol/L), and ketonemia (greater than 3 mmol/L) or significant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick).

The combination of hyperglycemia and ketosis causes diuresis, acidemia, and vomiting.

This patient's presentation goes with severe acidosis. In the evaluation of acid-base disorders, the anion gap should be calculated. Anion gap = sodium - (chloride + bicarbonate), with a normal range of 8 to 12 mEq/L.",Arterial blood gas,Abdominal ultrasonography,²-hydroxybutyrate level,Serum lactate level measurement,Chest x-ray,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient's high blood sugar level, ketonuria, and respiratory rate are all indicative of DKA. The next step in evaluating this patient would be to measure the ²-hydroxybutyrate level, which is a more specific and sensitive marker of ketoacidosis than the urine ketone test. This would help to confirm the diagnosis of DKA and guide further management. An arterial blood gas (A) would also be useful in evaluating the patient's acid-base status, but it is not the next step in evaluation. Abdominal ultrasonography (B) and chest x-ray (E) are not indicated at this point, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of an abdominal or respiratory problem.

Rationale: Quinine is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in pregnant women in Africa, especially in the first trimester. This is because artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has not been extensively studied in pregnant women, and there are concerns about its safety. Quinine has been used for many years and is considered safe in pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, ACT may be used if quinine is not available or if the patient has failed quinine treatment. Chloroquine is not effective against P. falciparum in Africa due to widespread resistance. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), not for treatment of acute malaria. Mefloquine is not recommended in the first trimester due to concerns about its safety.",False,model6

She is 24 weeks pregnant, and until now, her pregnancy is unremarkable. She has no significant history. Shortly after presentation, she has a seizure. Vital signs are heart rate 107 bpm, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, blood pressure 164/98 mm Hg, and temperature 98.6° F (37° C). Eclampsia is suspected to be the etiology of her seizure, and magnesium is administered. The patient is admitted to the hospital for management. While the patient is on a magnesium drip, which of the following must be monitored?
###Options:
A.  Complete metabolic panel with magnesium and phosphate levels every 4 hours.
B.  Reflex checks every 1 hour.
C.  Reflex checks every 4 hourS.
D.  Fetal monitor every 30 minutes.
E.  Electrocardiogram every 2 hours.

###Answer:",B,"While magnesium levels are important to evaluate for magnesium toxicity, rechecking levels every 4 hours is not appropriate as patients on a magnesium drip need to be evaluated every hour.

Patients treated with magnesium, especially those pregnant, need to be reevaluated every hour for magnesium toxicity. This can be achieved by checking patellar reflexes, which would be diminished in magnesium toxicity.

Fetal monitoring is important; however, care for the mother is essential in ensuring the pregnancy is successful as patients who are not treated for magnesium toxicity can quickly become comatose.

Obtaining an ECG is vital as electrolyte abnormalities can cause dysrhythmias; however, continuous ECGs every 2 hours are not recommended. Instead, the focus should be maintained on evaluating for magnesium electrolyte abnormalities through patellar reflex checks every 1 hour.",Complete metabolic panel with magnesium and phosphate levels every 4 hours.,Reflex checks every 1 hour.,Reflex checks every 4 hourS.,Fetal monitor every 30 minutes.,Electrocardiogram every 2 hours.,B,"B. Reflex checks every 1 hour.

Rationale: Magnesium is commonly used in the management of eclampsia to prevent further seizures. One of the potential side effects of magnesium is neuromuscular blockade, which can lead to respiratory depression. The earliest sign of magnesium toxicity is often loss of deep tendon reflexes. Therefore, reflex checks (such as patellar or Achilles tendon reflexes) should be performed frequently, ideally every hour, to monitor for early signs of toxicity. Complete metabolic panels and electrocardiograms are not necessary to monitor for magnesium toxicity. Fetal monitoring is important in the management of eclampsia, but it is not directly related to magnesium administration.",True,model6

Rationale: Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension. It can cause reflex tachycardia and postural hypotension, especially during initial administration. This is because the sudden decrease in peripheral resistance can lead to a compensatory increase in heart rate and cardiac output. The postural hypotension is due to the blockade of alpha-1 receptors, which normally help to maintain blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction.",True,model6

C.  Ultrasonography
D.  Endometrial biopsy
E.  Hysterosalpingography

###Answer:",D,The next step in the management of a 45-year-old patient with uterine leiomyomata and excessive uterine bleeding should be an endometrial biopsy. This is because excessive uterine bleeding in a patient with uterine leiomyomata could be due to endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma.

###Options:
A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:",A,"Pistol-shot femoral pulses refer to bounding, rapid, and forceful arterial pulses palpated in the femoral arteries, characteristic of aortic regurgitation. These pulses result from the rapid runoff of blood from the aorta into the peripheral arteries during diastole, causing a quick rise and fall in arterial pressure.",True,False,,,,A,"A

Rationale: In aortic regurgitation, the regurgitant flow from the aorta into the left ventricle can cause a sudden increase in pressure in the femoral arteries, producing a loud, sharp sound (pistol-shot sound) when the femoral pulse is palpated. This is known as Traube's sign.",True,model6

Rationale: 
Lung cancer is strongly associated with tobacco use, with up to 80-90% of lung cancer deaths attributed to smoking. The symptoms of lung cancer often include chronic cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and weight loss. These symptoms are typically seen in advanced stages of the disease.

###Options:
A.  Fluid overload
B.  Increased Cardiac Output
C.  Left heart failure
D.  Reactive airway disease
E.  All of the above

###Answer:",C,"Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms of sudden dyspnea, crackles around the scapulae, and history of hypertension are suggestive of left heart failure. Left heart failure occurs when the left side of the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to a buildup of fluid in the lungs. The tripod position, where the patient sits upright and leans forward to breathe, is a compensatory mechanism to relieve respiratory distress. Therefore, the correct answer is left heart failure.",Fluid overload,Increased Cardiac Output,Left heart failure,Reactive airway disease,All of the above,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of dyspnea and orthopnea (need to sit up in a tripod position to breathe), are consistent with left heart failure. The presence of crackles around the scapulae suggests pulmonary edema, which is a complication of left heart failure. The patient's history of hypertension increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as hypertension is a major risk factor for heart failure.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,Bleeding from umbilical stump is a characteristic feature of Factor XIII deficiency.,Factor XIII deficiency,VWF deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Glanzmann thrombosthenia,None of the above,A,"A
Rationale: Factor XIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that can present with bleeding from the umbilical stump, in addition to other symptoms such as poor wound healing, bruising, and intracranial bleeding. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the F13A or F13B genes, which code for the A and B subunits of factor XIII, respectively. Factor XIII is a transglutaminase that plays a crucial role in stabilizing blood clots by forming covalent bonds between fibrin molecules. In the absence of factor XIII, blood clots are unstable and prone to lysis, leading to bleeding complications.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Infection of the vagina
B.  Endometrial cancer
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Leiomyoma
E.  Precocious puberty

###Answer:",E,"Precocious puberty should be suspected if bleeding is assoicated with early development of secondary sexual characteristics, particularly breast development. Infection of the vagina can result in isolated abnormal bleeding but given the secondary sexual characteristics this is unlikely. Endometrial cancer, leiomyomata and hyperthyroidism do not fit the presentation.",Infection of the vagina,Endometrial cancer,Hyperthyroidism,Leiomyoma,Precocious puberty,E,"E. Precocious puberty

Rationale: Precocious puberty is a condition in which puberty begins too early, typically before age 8 in girls and 9 in boys. It is characterized by the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast growth and menstruation. In this scenario, the patient is 8 years old and has developed breasts, which is consistent with precocious puberty. The presence of blood in her underwear may indicate the onset of menstruation, which is also a symptom of precocious puberty. While infection of the vagina (A) and leiomyoma (D) are possible causes of vaginal bleeding, they are less likely given the patient's age and the presence of breast development. Endometrial cancer (B) is extremely rare in children and is not a likely cause of vaginal bleeding in an 8-year-old girl. Hyperthyroidism (C) can cause menstrual irregularities, but it is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding in children.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,Stopping oestrogen containing medications is effective in most cases. If symptoms persist treatments such as ablation or boric acid pessaries can be given.,ablation,stop estrogen containing medications,antibiotic therapy,boric acid pessaries,,A,"A

Rationale: Cervical ectropion is a condition characterized by the presence of columnar epithelium on the ectocervix. It is usually asymptomatic but may cause symptoms like vaginal discharge, bleeding, or postcoital bleeding. Symptomatic cervical ectropion is usually treated by ablative methods, such as cryotherapy or electrocautery, to remove the abnormal epithelium. Stopping estrogen-containing medications may be helpful in reducing the size of the ectropion but is not a definitive treatment. Antibiotic therapy is not indicated as ectropion is not an infectious condition. Boric acid pessaries may be used to treat vaginal infections but are not a treatment for cervical ectropion.",False,model6

He has a history of asthma, for which he takes inhaled corticosteroids once a day. He returned from a 3-day camping trip five days ago and was alright throughout the trip. He has a smoking history of 15-pack-years and a history of alcohol consumption of 20 years and consumes around 15 drinks/week. He has a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin for the last 30 years. Laboratory investigations reveal a hemoglobin of 16.9 g/dL, ESR of 30 mm, blood glucose 150 mg/dL, WBC count of 14000/µL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen is 10 mg/dL, total bilirubin is 2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin is 0.3 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL and platelet levels of 500000/µL. Physical examination reveals scratch marks over the body. There is no evidence of icterus, but splenomegaly is present. What is the probable diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Mast cell activation syndrome
B.  Uremia
C.  Polycythemia vera
D.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis
E.  Tuberculosis

###Answer:",C,"This patient with a history of incessant itching and burning over the body especially in the mornings, and a raised WBC count, platelet count, and splenomegaly, and a smoking history of 15-pack-years, is probably a case of polycythemia vera. The association of itching with mornings is probably due to a hot water shower owing to the cold temperatures in Atlanta. This is also known as aquagenic pruritus. Management of pruritus is an avoidance of the trigger, especially hot water. Antihistamines and topical moisturizers may help. Aspirin also helps in alleviating pruritus.

Peripheral blood smear in pre-polycythemic and overt polycythemic stage shows normochromic and normocytic RBCs, erythrocytosis with elevated hemoglobin (greater than 16.5 g/dL in male and 16.0 g/dL in female), leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. However, in concomitant iron deficiency, smear shows a microcytic and hypochromic picture. In the post-polycythemic myelofibrosis stage, blood smear is characterized by leukoerythroblastosis, with teardrop-shaped RBCs and poikilocytosis.

Janus kinase gene is a type of protein kinase which phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in the JAK-STAT pathway, and activation of this pathway results in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The JAK2 mutation is found in about 70% of MPNs. It is a somatic mutation that involves the substitution of valine to phenylalanine at codon 617 (JAK2 V617F) in the pseudokinase domain. The frequency of JAK2 V617F mutation is 95% in patients with PV.

Mast cell activation syndrome involves a positive family history and is unrelated to hot water exposure. Uremia is unlikely in this patient with mildly elevated creatinine and normal BUN. Primary sclerosing cholangitis can present with pruritis and in severe cases splenomegaly secondary to cirrhosis but would present with raised bilirubin levels with a high direct bilirubin component, and pruritus unrelated to hot water exposure, making this diagnosis less likely.

The laboratory investigations reveal a hemoglobin level of 16.9 g/dL, which is elevated, and a platelet count of 500000/µL, which is also elevated. These findings are consistent with polycythemia vera. The patient also has splenomegaly, which is a common finding in polycythemia vera. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption is not directly related to the symptoms.

###Answer:",D,"Anemia is defined as the reduction in circulating red-cell mass below normal levels.

Microcytic, hypochromic anemia is the type of anemia in which the circulating red blood cells are smaller than the usual size of RBCs and have decreased red color (hypochromic).

This may be due to poor absorption of iron from the gut, decreased iron in the diet, acute and chronic blood loss, increased demand of iron in certain situations like pregnancy, or recovering from major trauma or surgery.

###Answer:",E,"The patient appears to be suffering from cushingoid symptoms. After a history to exclude causes such as high-dose steroid intake, the main differential diagnoses include an adrenal tumour, an ectopic tumour producing ACTH (Cushings syndrome) or a pituitary tumour (Cushings disease). Although a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level measurement (E) does not confirm the exact diagnosis, it does indicate if there is a pathological excess of cortisol (levels can vary up to 700nmol/L in the morning to 280nmol/L at midnight). A low dose (0.5mg) dexamethasone test (A) involves measuring ACTH after dexamethasone administration. In Cushings disease and syndrome, there is no suppression of ACTH. A high- dose dexamethasone test (B) will differentiate between Cushings disease and Cushings syndrome since only in the former is there suppressed ACTH production after high-dose dexamethasone administration. A CT scan (D) can be used to identify a pituitary tumour if requiring surgical management. Urinary catecholamine (C) measurement is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal tumour producing excess catecholamines measurable in the urine. Differentiating an adrenal tumour producing excess cortisol can be done by administering metyrapone, an 11-² hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, which effectively ceases adrenal cortisol production.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, which include weight gain, particularly in the central part of the body, a rounded face, and high blood pressure. The presence of bruises on her arm suggests that she may have skin thinning, which is another feature of Cushing's syndrome. The most appropriate initial investigation would be to measure urinary free cortisol, which is a screening test for Cushing's syndrome. A low-dose dexamethasone test is used to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, whereas a high-dose dexamethasone test is used to differentiate between Cushing's disease (a pituitary tumour) and ectopic ACTH production.

###Options:
A.  Arrange for a chest x-ray and physiotherapy to manage likely chest infection
B.  Examine wounds for infection and allow them to open if infected
C.  Arrange for an ultrasound scan to look for intra-abdominal collection
D.  Change antibiotics to second line and involve microbiology
E.  Place an NG tube and allow decompression of likely post-operative adhesions

###Answer:",C,Children who present with ruptured appendices are at increased risk of intra abdominal collections or abscesses. A swinging temperature is the first clue in indicating an intra abdominal abscess in a patient who had recently undergone surgery for a perforated appendix. The best course of action is therefore to get an ultrasound of the fluid collection before proceeding to rule out any other complication.,Arrange for a chest x-ray and physiotherapy to manage likely chest infection,Examine wounds for infection and allow them to open if infected,Arrange for an ultrasound scan to look for intra-abdominal collection,Change antibiotics to second line and involve microbiology,Place an NG tube and allow decompression of likely post-operative adhesions,C,"C. Arrange for an ultrasound scan to look for intra-abdominal collection

Rationale: The patient has developed fever after a laparoscopic appendicectomy for a perforated appendix. This suggests that there may be an intra-abdominal collection or abscess. The next step in management would be to arrange for an ultrasound scan to look for intra-abdominal collection. The ultrasound scan would help in identifying any fluid collection or abscess that may need to be drained.",True,model6

His last visit was 7 years ago and he claims to be otherwise in good health. He has been compliant with his antireflux medications, including an H2-blocker and a proton pump inhibitor. At this visit, it is most appropriate to perform which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Double the dose of his H2-blocker and schedule him for follow-up in 4 weeks
B.  Double the dose of his proton pump inhibitor and schedule him for follow-up in 4 weeks
C.  Perform an esophagoscopy
D.  Schedule him for elective esophagectomy
E.  Schedule him for emergent Nissen fundoplication

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is C. A one-timeesophagoscopy is recommended in patients 50years or older to evaluate for the developmentof esophageal metaplasia (Barretts esophagus).There is a direct correlation between the development of Barretts esophagus and history ofgastroesophageal reflux disease. If metaplasia ispresent, these patients are 30 to 125 timesmore likely to develop adenocarcinoma. Anesophagoscopy and biopsy could help discernwhether this patient has a Barretts esophagusor has already progressed to an early stage cancer that has yet to cause dysphagia and weightloss.Answer A is incorrect. Although doubling themedication dose may provide symptomatic relief of the gastroesophageal reflux disease, itdoes not tell us anything about the damagethat has been done to the esophagus as a resultof the condition. To properly manage the disease, it is necessary to evaluate for metaplasia.Answer B is incorrect. Changing the medication dose may provide further symptomatic relief of the gastroesophageal reflux disease, butthis patient is in need of an esophagoscopy toevaluate for metaplasia in order to properlymanage the disease.Answer D is incorrect. Esophagectomy is typically indicated for the removal of long segments of metaplasia in patients with Barrettsesophagus. In this patient, it is unknown ifthere is any metaplasia, so an esophagoscopyshould be performed first.Answer E is incorrect. There is no indicationfor any emergent surgical procedure. Nissenfundoplication is typically used for active reflux that is refractory to medical management.",Double the dose of his H2-blocker and schedule him for follow-up in 4 weeks,Double the dose of his proton pump inhibitor and schedule him for follow-up in 4 weeks,Perform an esophagoscopy,Schedule him for elective esophagectomy,Schedule him for emergent Nissen fundoplication,C,"C

Rationale: The patient has a 20-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and has been compliant with his medications. However, his symptoms have worsened over the past 18 months. This suggests that he may have developed Barrett's esophagus, which is a complication of long-standing GERD. Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition that can progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it is essential to perform an esophagoscopy to evaluate the patient for Barrett's esophagus and rule out any other complications of GERD.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH)
B.  Luteinizing hormone
C.  Progesterone
D.  Oestrogen
E.  Testosterone

###Answer:",B,Luteinizing hormone is responsible for triggering ovulation in menstrual cycle,Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH),Luteinizing hormone,Progesterone,Oestrogen,Testosterone,B,"B.  Luteinizing hormone

Rationale: 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) is the primary hormone responsible for triggering ovulation in females during the menstrual cycle. LH is released from the pituitary gland and stimulates the dominant follicle to release the ovum from the ovary. The surge in LH levels typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle and is often referred to as the LH surge. This surge in LH triggers ovulation, which usually occurs 24-48 hours after the peak LH levels.",True,model6

Rationale: 
Mixed feeding (both breastfeeding and formula feeding) before 6 months of age is associated with a higher risk of HIV transmission compared to exclusive breastfeeding. This is because mixed feeding can cause gastrointestinal inflammation, making the infant more susceptible to HIV infection. Exclusive breastfeeding, on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of HIV transmission compared to mixed feeding.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Systemic arterial pressure increases
B.  Ductus arteriosus closes
C.  Left ventricular pressure increases
D.  Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",D,"The pulmonary vascular resistance greatly decreases as a result of expansion of the lungs.

Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases

Rationale: 
The pressure in the pulmonary artery decreases greatly after birth due to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. This is because the lungs expand and oxygenate the blood, causing the pulmonary arterioles to dilate and reduce their resistance to blood flow. As a result, the pressure in the pulmonary artery decreases, and blood flow to the lungs increases.

A.  Right heart Faiure
B.  cyclic oedema
C.  hypoalbuminaemia
D.  pelvic tumour
E.  Amlodipine therapy

###Answer:",A,Absent hepatojugular reflux and raise Jugular venous pressure rules out right heart failure,Right heart Faiure,cyclic oedema,hypoalbuminaemia,pelvic tumour,Amlodipine therapy,A,"A

Rationale: The question is asking which condition would not explain the bilateral pitting oedema in the absence of raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) and negative hepatojugular reflux. The correct answer is A. Right heart failure. Right heart failure would cause an increase in JVP, which is not seen in this patient. The other options (B-E) are all causes of peripheral oedema that would not necessarily cause an increase in JVP. Cyclic oedema is a condition where women experience fluid retention and oedema in response to hormonal changes.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydration. The laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis with a low pH and bicarbonate level, and the presence of ketones in the urine. The medication that caused these symptoms is canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which is known to increase the risk of DKA. This is likely due to the fact that SGLT2 inhibitors increase glucagon levels and decrease insulin levels, which can lead to an increase in ketone production.

B.  Administer dexamethasone and perform a lumbar puncture.
C.  Administer ketorolac and perform a brain CAT scan.
D.  Administer a triptan and ketorolac, and perform an electroencephalogram.
E.  None

###Answer:",C,"NSAIDs are one of the first-line treatments for acute migraine attacks and other acute headaches. Neuroimaging is indicated in this patient for a first or worst episode, abnormal neurologic examination (such as a stiff neck), and new episodes in older patients (more than 50 years old).

Other neuroimaging indications could be other neurological symptoms or signs (confusion, neck, papilledema, epilepsy), non-typical characteristics, resistance to treatment, immunosuppressed patients, and systemic or meningeal signs or symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue).

Typically brain CT scan (with or without contrast) is sufficient as a primary neuroimaging method. However, other methods can be used, such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, or venography.

Discharging the patient would not be the best option because of the great suspicion of a secondary headache. Dexamethasone is not a single first-line option, and lumbar punction should preferably be made after neuroimaging.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), particularly with the presence of neck stiffness and the worst headache ever. SAH is a medical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and management. The most appropriate next step is to perform a brain CAT scan to rule out SAH. Ketorolac can be administered to help manage the patient's pain. A lumbar puncture may be necessary if the CAT scan is negative, but it should not be performed before imaging.

Red cell pyruvate kinase levels are low. Inheritance of pyruvate kinase disease is autosomal recessive. Aplastic anemia from Parvovirus B-19 infection may occur.

The other listed conditions are unlikely complications. Stroke may complicate sickle cell disease. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may rarely cause a pulmonary embolism.",Stroke,Liver cirrhosis,Aplastic anemia,Pulmonary embolism,Renal failure,E,"E. Renal failure

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder that causes red blood cell hemolysis. G6PD deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and dark urine. Complications of G6PD deficiency include acute hemolytic crisis, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, and thus, renal failure.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Unopposed parasympathetic nervous system input
B.  Unopposed sympathetic nervous system input
C.  Unopposed somatic nervous system input
D.  Lesions to the first four cranial nerves
E.  None of the above

Thus, if the former is unopposed, we have fixed, dilated pupils that cannot be antagonised.",Unopposed parasympathetic nervous system input,Unopposed sympathetic nervous system input,Unopposed somatic nervous system input,Lesions to the first four cranial nerves,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Fixed and dilated pupils are a sign of unopposed sympathetic nervous system input. This can occur due to lesions or damage to the parasympathetic nervous system, which normally provides opposing input to the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system, via the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), is responsible for constricting the pupils. If the parasympathetic input is lost, the sympathetic nervous system, which dilates the pupils, becomes unopposed, resulting in fixed and dilated pupils.",True,model6

Rationale: In African children with sickle cell disease, vaso-occlusive crises often present with pallor due to anemia, which is a common symptom. Jaundice may be present due to hemolysis, but it is not a primary symptom of vaso-occlusive crises. Priapism is a less common symptom of sickle cell disease, usually seen in older children and adults. Splenomegaly is not typically seen in African children with sickle cell disease, as the spleen usually infarcts and atrophies early in life due to repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion.",False,model6

###Answer:",A,Oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary gland ,Oxytocin,GH,LH,TSH,ACTH,A,"A. Oxytocin

Rationale: Oxytocin is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland, not the anterior pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary gland produces and secretes several hormones, including growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin, among others.

E.  (E)	no significant change in histology

###Answer:",A,"After menopause, the breast undergoes involution. There is a decrease in the acinar and ductal elements and generalized atrophy.

Rationale: As women age and enter menopause, the breast tissue undergoes involutional changes. The number and size of acinar glands and ductal elements decrease, leading to a decrease in the density of the breast parenchyma. This is a normal process that occurs as hormone levels decrease. The breast tissue is replaced by fatty tissue, making the breast less dense. This change is important to recognize, as it can affect the interpretation of mammograms.",True,model6

Rationale: The first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women is quinine, especially during the first trimester. Quinine is an effective and safe treatment option for malaria in pregnancy. Although chloroquine is also used for malaria treatment, it is not the first-line treatment for pregnant women. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is not recommended during the first trimester due to concerns about its safety.

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is D. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) among moderate toheavy drinkers and alcoholics is 1050%. Thediagnosis is based upon three criteria: growth retardation (confirmed pre- or postnatal weight orheight d 10th percentile), facial dysmorphia(smooth philtrum, thin vermilion border, shortpalpebral fissures, hypoplastic midface, and microcephaly), and central nervous system abnormalities (structural or functional abnormalities,including mental retardation). FAS patients alsohave an increased risk of cardiac defects.",Eclampsia,Hypoplastic lung,Macrosomia,Microcephaly,Polyhydramnios,D,"D. Microcephaly

Rationale: 
Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of birth defects and learning and behavioral problems that occur in children whose mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy. The effects of alcohol on the fetus depend on the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption, as well as the timing of exposure during pregnancy. The risk of FAS is highest when the mother consumes alcohol during the first trimester, which is the period of organogenesis. 

Microcephaly (small head size) is a hallmark feature of FAS, and it is often accompanied by other craniofacial abnormalities, such as a smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. The other options are not directly related to FAS. Eclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by seizures, hypertension, and proteinuria. Hypoplastic lung refers to underdeveloped lungs, which can occur in conditions such as Potter syndrome. Macrosomia refers to a large birth weight, which can occur in infants of diabetic mothers. Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, which can occur in conditions such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome.",True,model6

Common Variable Immunodeficiency

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including recurrent respiratory infections and low immunoglobulin levels, suggest an immunodeficiency disorder. The lack of response to pneumococcal vaccines further supports this diagnosis. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) and impaired antibody responses to antigens.

An epidural is placed and functions well. The patient suddenly develops severe abdominal pain, which she describes to her nurse as a tearing sensation. External maternal-fetal monitoring, which has been Category I, shows a sudden drop in the fetal heart rate to 50 bpm. The maternal heart rate jumps to 130 bpm and her blood pressure is now 90/50 mm Hg. The patient is brought to the operating room for an emergent cesarean birth. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this event?
###Options:
A.  Mechanical cervical dilation with oxytocin administration
B.  Multiparity
C.  Trial of labor after cesarean birth
D.  Advanced maternal age
E.  Blood pressure

###Answer:",C,"This patient has signs and symptoms concerning for uterine rupture: fetal bradycardia, sudden-onset severe abdominal pain that is not masked by an epidural, and maternal hemodynamic instability. Another key finding often present is a loss of fetal station.

The biggest risk factor for uterine rupture is a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). The incidence of uterine rupture in an unscarred uterus is roughly 1 rupture per 10,000 to 25,000 deliveries. The incidence of uterine rupture for women in labor with 1 previous cesarean delivery is approximately 0.3% to 1%. The incidence increases in patients with more than 1 cesarean birth, though the exact increase is somewhat unclear; estimates range from 0.9% to nearly 4%.

The study cited in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin noted the risk of uterine rupture was 0.9% and 1.8% in women with 1 versus 2 prior cesarean births. ACOG notes that a TOLAC is reasonable to offer appropriately selected well-counseled patients with 2 prior cesarean births.

The risk of uterine rupture is slightly higher in women of advanced maternal age who undergo a TOLAC compared to younger women. Multiparty and induction of labor are also risk factors for uterine rupture. These risk factors have a much smaller effect on the rate of uterine rupture, however, than a TOLAC.Of note, the use of misoprostol is contraindicated in patients undergoing TOLAC due to a significant increase in uterine rupture risk. For this reason, mechanical dilation and oxytocin are recommended over prostaglandins in parturients requiring induction or augmentation while undergoing a TOLAC.

Rationale: 
The effectiveness of platelet transfusion therapy can be assessed by measuring the platelet count before and after the transfusion. This is because platelet transfusion is used to treat thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or platelet dysfunction. The platelet count is the most direct measure of the effectiveness of the therapy. Bleeding time (A) is a measure of platelet function, but it is not as accurate as the platelet count. Peripheral blood film (B) can provide information about platelet morphology, but it is not a quantitative measure.

###Answer:",E,"The morbidity and mortality (< 3%) of Kawasaki disease (KD) are overwhelmingly associated with the development of inflammatory coronary artery aneurysms, most of which are asymptomatic at the time of formation.

Aneurysms may be detected by echocardiography. Thrombosis can occur in the aneurysms, resulting in direct or embolic coronary artery occlusion.

Coronary events may occur weeks or even many years after the febrile illness. A baseline echocardiogram should be obtained at the time of the acute illness and should be repeated 2 and 6 weeks later.

Early recognition of the disease and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin have significantly decreased the frequency of aneurysm formation and thrombotic coronary events.

* History of previous respiratory problems
* History of previous intubation

Stridor when agitated (Option A) is not a specific criterion for hospital assessment, as stridor can be present in croup and may be more pronounced when the child is agitated. Barking cough (Option B) is a characteristic feature of croup, but it does not necessarily indicate the need for hospital assessment. Temperature 38.5 (Option C) is a moderate fever, but it is not a specific criterion for hospital assessment in croup. Papular erythematous blanching rash on the trunk (Option D) is not a feature of croup, and it may indicate an alternative diagnosis such as a viral exanthem. Intercostal recession at rest (Option E) is a sign of severe respiratory distress and indicates the need for hospital assessment.",True,model6

In the ED, she has three more seizures in a 5 minute period where she is seen convulsing on the floor in her husband's arms. Between each seizure, the patient did not return to her normal baseline. Vitals reveals a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, a pulse of 90 beats per minute, a temperature of 98.7 F, and respirations of 30 breaths/minute. A thorough physical exam was challenging due to an actively convulsing patient. The first-line drug was not available. What is the effect of the second-line drug whose mechanism of action involves lengthening the time chloride gates stay in an open state?
###Options:
A.  It stabilizes neuronal membranes
B.  It Inhibits synaptic transmission in the cortex

D.  It affects the limbic system and thalamus
E.  It inhibits brain concentrations of GABA

###Answer:",C,"Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis.

The primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of polysynaptic transmissions in the cortex.

In high doses, barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity. Phenobarbital is a 2nd line agent for the treatment of status epilepticus. First-line drugs for this condition are Benzodiazepines.

Phenobarbital exhibits its effect on the central nervous system.",It stabilizes neuronal membranes,It Inhibits synaptic transmission in the cortex,It enhances brain concentrations of GABA,It affects the limbic system and thalamus,It inhibits brain concentrations of GABA,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is experiencing status epilepticus, which is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt treatment. The first-line medication is benzodiazepine (typically diazepam or lorazepam), which works by enhancing the activity of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In the absence of benzodiazepine, the second-line medication is barbiturate (typically phenobarbital). The mechanism of action of barbiturates involves lengthening the time chloride gates stay in an open state, which in turn increases the duration of the chloride channel opening. This results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the neuron, causing hyperpolarization and stabilization of the neuronal membrane, ultimately leading to enhanced brain concentrations of GABA.",True,model6

",Compete uterine involution,Uterine sub-involution,Lactogenesis is occurring,First postpartum menstrual period,Ovarian involution,B,"B. Uterine sub-involution

Rationale: 
During the postpartum period, the uterus undergoes involution, which is a process of reduction in size and return to its pre-pregnant state. This process typically takes 2 weeks. Lochia, which is the vaginal discharge after childbirth, changes color as the involution process progresses. Initially, it is red (lochia rubra), then becomes pinkish (lochia serosa), and finally becomes white or yellowish (lochia alba). If lochia rubra persists beyond 7-10 days, it may indicate uterine sub-involution, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, retained placental tissue, or hormonal imbalance.",True,model6

D.  Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), increased luteinizing hormone (LH)
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"This woman is most likely presenting with a pituitary prolactinoma. Prolactinomas present with elevated prolactin levels and decreased levels of FSH and LH. This is due to negative feedback from the increased prolactin. Prolactinomas commonly cause amenorrhea and galactorrhea, like in this patient. A serum level of prolactin should be elevated, and an MRI will reveal a tumor. In the evaluation of a prolactinoma, a serum TSH level must be done as hyperprolactinemia can be caused by an elevated thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).

Prolactinomas are benign pituitary tumors of the lactotroph cells, resulting in hypersecretion of prolactin. In premenopausal women, common presenting symptoms include amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, and decreased libido. Prolactinomas that are large can also cause compression of the optic nerve and cause visual disturbances, such as blurry vision, loss of vision, and bitemporal hemianopsia with compression at the level of the optic chiasm.

Men exhibit decreased libido and headaches.

Treatment is aimed at decreasing the size of the tumor with dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. These medications can suppress prolactin secretion. Large tumors or tumors that do not respond to dopamine agonists may require surgical removal.","Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)","Decreased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)","Decreased prolactin, increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), increased luteinizing hormone (LH)","Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), increased luteinizing hormone (LH)",none,A,"A.  Increased prolactin, decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), decreased luteinizing hormone (LH)

Rationale: 
The patient is presenting with bilateral breast milk discharge, which is a symptom of hyperprolactinemia. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a prolactinoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. Prolactin inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn inhibits the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland. Therefore, in a patient with hyperprolactinemia, the levels of FSH and LH would be decreased. The patient's symptoms of headaches and decreased libido are also consistent with a pituitary tumor. The MRI of the brain would be used to visualize the pituitary gland and identify any tumors. Serology would be used to rule out other causes of hyperprolactinemia, such as hypothyroidism or certain medications.",True,model6

Rationale: The presence of a unilateral ovarian neoplasm alongside a large omental metastasis, with a frozen section diagnosis confirming metastatic serous cystadenocarcinoma, strongly suggests that the patient has advanced ovarian cancer. The standard surgical approach for advanced ovarian cancer includes a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy.

A history of present illness reveals that she has had similar episodes several times in the past 2 weeks. She says her fingers turn white, followed by redness on warming her hands. Her medical history includes systemic lupus erythematosus. On physical examination, the capillary refill time is 6 seconds, and blanching of the fingers results in cyanosis followed by erythema. Which of the following has the patient developed?
###Options:
A.  Occlusive peripheral vascular disease
B.  Primary Raynaud phenomenon
C.  Secondary Raynaud phenomenon
D.  Peripheral neuropathy
E.  septicemia

###Answer:",C,"Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by vasoconstriction of the digital arteries and cutaneous arterioles. In primary Raynaud phenomenon, blood-flow restriction occurs during cold temperatures and emotional stress.

The secondary Raynaud phenomenon has different etiologies. It is most commonly associated with connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, and antiphospholipid syndrome.

A Raynaud phenomenon attack is sudden with the development of cold digits and the demarcation of ""white"" areas, also known as skin pallor or white attack.

She is on rate control with bisoprolol, and is currently asymptomatic with a heart rate of 76bpm. Her recent ECHO is grossly normal. She has a high CHA2DS2VASc score and the cardiologist is planning to start her on oral anticoagulation. She has a PMH of severe OA, HTN and TIA. Her mobility is very poor and finds it very difficult to attend her hospital appointments, and confides in the cardiologist that she does often forget to take her pills, although she is now using a special box from the pharmacy which contains all the days medication  and she finds that very helpful indeed!

###Answer:",C,"The most suitable option for anticoagulation in this case would be to consider a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). DOACs are oral medications that are effective in preventing blood clots in atrial fibrillation patients. They have been shown to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants like warfarin but have the advantage of not requiring frequent blood monitoring. Since the patient has mobility issues and difficulty attending appointments, a DOAC would be a more convenient option for her.

Apixaban 5mg BD

Rationale: 
The patient has a high CHA2DS2VASc score and is at high risk of stroke. Therefore, anticoagulation is indicated. However, she has a history of poor mobility and forgetfulness, which makes warfarin a less suitable option. Warfarin requires frequent INR monitoring, which may be challenging for this patient. Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), does not require monitoring and is a suitable option. It is also more effective than aspirin and has a lower risk of bleeding compared to warfarin. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that is administered subcutaneously and is not a suitable option for long-term anticoagulation.",False,model6

Initially described in the early 1980s by Schmidt et al., the dawn phenomenon differs from the Somogyi effect in that an episode of hypoglycemia does not precede it.

Patients with diabetes will manifest the dawn phenomenon clinically with persistent and worsening early morning hyperglycemia, which is difficult to control. Often found early in the disease process, this is associated with worsening HbA1c levels. The dawn phenomenon is not associated with nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes; no specific physical findings are present.

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is option (A) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland and acts on the thyroid gland to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.",Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG),Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),Calcitonin,Parathyroid hormone (PTH),A,"A. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

Rationale: 
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland and plays a crucial role in regulating the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) into the bloodstream. These hormones, in turn, regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism, growth, and development.

Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a protein that binds to and transports thyroid hormones in the bloodstream, but it does not stimulate their synthesis or secretion. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus and stimulates the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary gland, but it does not directly stimulate the thyroid gland. Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that helps regulate calcium levels in the blood, but it is not involved in the synthesis or secretion of thyroid hormones. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands and regulates calcium levels in the blood, but it is not involved in the synthesis or secretion of thyroid hormones.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Betamethasone
B.  Fludrocortisone
C.  Hydrocortisone
D.  Prednisone
E.  All of the above

###Answer:",A,"A corticosteroid with high glucocortiþcoid activity is needed to speed fetal lung maturation prior to delivery. Betamethasone has high glucocorticoid activþity and is one of the recommended drugs in this context. Dexamethasone is the other. Fludrocortisone mainly has mineralocorticoid activity and would not be useful in this situation. Hydrocortisone has much lower glucocorticoid activity. Prednisone has a higher glucocorticoid activity than hydrocortisone, but the fetus is not able to convert it to prednisolone, the active form.",Betamethasone,Fludrocortisone,Hydrocortisone,Prednisone,All of the above,A,"A

Rationale: Betamethasone is a glucocorticoid that is commonly used to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women in preterm labor. It has been shown to reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal mortality in preterm infants. Betamethasone is preferred over other corticosteroids because of its ability to cross the placenta and its relatively long half-life, which allows for a single dose to be effective for several days. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that is used to treat adrenal insufficiency and is not used for fetal lung maturation. Hydrocortisone and prednisone are also glucocorticoids, but they are not as effective as betamethasone for this indication.",True,model6

B.  switch to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
C.  Stop all antibiotics immediately
D.  Switch to amoxicillin
E.  Continue nitrofurantoin until the start of the third trimester

###Answer:",E,Nitrofurantoin is generally safe to use during pregnancy but it should be avoided at term (around the start of the third trimester) because it can cause hemolytic anemia in the fetus due to G6PD deficiency that cannot be compensated before this point.,Continue nitrofurantoin for entire pregnancy,switch to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,Stop all antibiotics immediately,Switch to amoxicillin,Continue nitrofurantoin until the start of the third trimester,D,"D. Switch to amoxicillin

Rationale: Nitrofurantoin is generally considered safe in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. However, it is not recommended in the last month of pregnancy because it can cause hemolytic anemia in newborns. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not recommended in the first trimester due to the risk of neural tube defects. Amoxicillin is a safer option in this scenario.

C.  (C)	block fetal genital steroid receptors
D.  (D)	provide negative feedback to the maternal pituitary
E.  (E)	block transplacental passage of maternal androgens

###Answer:",B,"Dexamethasone, given to the mother, crosses the placenta and suppresses ACTH secreting cells in the fetal pituitary. This inhibits fetal adrenal androgen secretion and prevents masculinization. The drug does not block fetal genital receptors. The purpose is not related to maternal androgens or maternal pituitary since these are not causative of the syndrome. Once the sex of the fetus is known and if the fetus is male, the androgen treatment can be stopped.",(A)	calm her anxiety,(B)	suppress fetal adrenal glad,(C)	block fetal genital steroid receptors,(D)	provide negative feedback to the maternal pituitary,(E)	block transplacental passage of maternal androgens,B,"B. (B)	suppress fetal adrenal glad

Rationale: Maternal dexamethasone administration can suppress the fetal adrenal gland, which is responsible for producing androgens that cause virilization of the female fetus. This is done in the first trimester, when the fetal adrenal gland is most active. The goal is to reduce the virilization of the female fetus. It is important to note that this treatment is only effective in preventing virilization, not in treating the underlying genetic disorder.",True,model6

A.  Ask if they ate any wild mushrooms.
B.  Ask about their workplace and if anyone else at work has similar symptoms.
C.  Ask if they have had a course of antibiotics recently.
D.  Ask if they have eaten any reheated rice within the last 24 to 48 hours.
E.  Ask if he has had a fever recently

###Answer:",B,"It is essential to know what exposures or situations puts a patient at risk for specific toxicities or syndromes. Organophosphates are notoriously found in pesticides and insecticides. Anyone who handles these types of substances is at risk for developing cholinergic toxicity.

This patient is experiencing cholinergic toxicity. This can commonly come in the form of organophosphate poisoning through pesticide exposure.

Sometimes exposures will be more apparent when several patients present with similar symptoms. It is easy to extract that those patients may have suffered exposure to the same toxin/substance. Early recognition of the exposure is important for early treatment and improved mortality. Getting the information about the patient's job and if anyone else has similar symptoms may cue the physician into organophosphate exposure and cholinergic toxicity as a result.

The differential diagnoses associated with cholinergic toxicity are long and difficult to differentiate. Obtaining a reliable history will aid tremendously and point the physician in the right direction of the correct diagnosis. The history is the most crucial portion of the initial evaluation for any exposure/toxicity. Eating wild mushrooms suggests mushroom poisoning, eating reheated rice could indicate food poisoning, and recent antibiotic use could indicate Clostridioides difficile, all of which may mimic symptoms found in cholinergic toxicity but vary widely in treatments.",Ask if they ate any wild mushrooms.,Ask about their workplace and if anyone else at work has similar symptoms.,Ask if they have had a course of antibiotics recently.,Ask if they have eaten any reheated rice within the last 24 to 48 hours.,Ask if he has had a fever recently,B,"B

Rationale: The symptoms described, such as excessive salivation, sweating, rhinorrhea, and lacrimation, are indicative of cholinergic toxicity. The best question to aid in diagnosis would be to ask about their workplace and if anyone else at work has similar symptoms (Option B). This is because the symptoms are consistent with exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which are commonly used in farming. If multiple people at the workplace are experiencing similar symptoms, it would suggest an environmental exposure rather than an isolated incident.",True,model6

During this time he has lost 25 lbs. The diarrhea is large volume, occasionally greasy, and nonbloody. In addition, the patient has mild abdominal pain for much of the day. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years and drinks approximately five beers per day. His physical examination reveals a thin male with temporal wasting and generalized muscle loss. He has glossitis and angular cheilosis.

###Options:
A.  chronic pancreatitis
B.  Crohn's disease
C.  Celiac sprue
D.  Whipple disease
E.  ulcerative colitis

###Answer:",C,"The patient has chronic diarrhea superimposed on a long history of loose stools, steatorrhea, and significant weight loss. While these features could be seen in several diseases, the presence of the pruritic vesiculopapular lesions on his extensor surfaces makes the diagnosis highly likely to be celiac sprue, with its frequently accompanying skin manifestation  dermatitis herpetiformis. Crohns disease is not usually associated with steatorrhea, and ulcerative colitis is often associated with bloody stools. Chronic pancreatitis and Whipple disease could cause a similar clinical picture but would not have the associated skin findings. A small bowel biopsy would confirm histopathologic features consistent with celiac sprue, such as villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia.  A small bowel biopsy could also diagnose or rule out Whipple disease by looking for the pathognomonic PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) positive organism  Tropheryma whippelii. Colonic biopsies would be unhelpful in celiac sprue.  A fecal fat quantification would likely confirm and assess the degree of steatorrhea, but would offer little other diagnostic information.  A small bowel x-ray is too nonspecific to confirm the diagnosis and an abdominal CT scan would likely be normal unless the patient had developed a complication of advanced sprue, such as intestinal lymphoma. Patients with celiac sprue are at increased risk for malignancies of the small bowel with adenocarcinoma and lymphoma being the two most commonly encountered. Patients with celiac sprue are not at greatly increased risk of the other malignancies listed. Limited data suggest that strict adherence to a glutenfree diet may decrease the incidence of malignancy in these patients.",chronic pancreatitis,Crohn's disease,Celiac sprue,Whipple disease,ulcerative colitis,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of celiac sprue. The patient has a long history of loose stools, which is consistent with malabsorption. The presence of large-volume, greasy stools suggests steatorrhea, which is a hallmark of pancreatic insufficiency or small intestine malabsorption. The patient's significant weight loss and muscle wasting are consistent with malabsorption of protein and calories. The presence of glossitis and angular cheilosis suggests a deficiency of the B vitamin complex, which is commonly seen in patients with malabsorption. The skin lesions are consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a common skin manifestation of celiac sprue. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may contribute to his symptoms, but they are not the primary cause of his malabsorption.",True,model6

The best results have been only in patients with late-onset Krabbe disease who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and treated before severe symptoms develop. But in infants with early-onset Krabbe disease who have already developed symptoms, HSCT has not been much help.

There is no known evidence that dietary modifications significantly alter the clinical course of Krabbe disease. Although infants may ultimately need tube feedings for adequate energy intake; however, nutritional support does not change the disease course. Therefore, HSCT is the only modality of treatment that can alter the disease outcome prominently.

Neurologic sequelae of Krabbe disease may hinder adequate physical activity. Therefore, patients may benefit from both physical and occupational therapy. However, based on various researches and evidence, the best modality of treatment for Krabbe disease is hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCST).

###Options:
A.  Congenital pyloric obstruction
B.  Imperforate anus
C.  Oesophageal atresia
D.  Hirschsprung's disease
E.  Gastroschisis

###Answer:",A,disease conditions which impair movement of bowel contents cause distension,Congenital pyloric obstruction,Imperforate anus,Oesophageal atresia,Hirschsprung's disease,Gastroschisis,D,"D

Rationale: The age of the patient (3 months) and the presenting symptom (abdominal distension) suggest that congenital anomalies that present with obstruction or delayed passage of stool should be considered. Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital disorder that presents with abdominal distension, delayed passage of meconium, and constipation. Although the other options are congenital anomalies, they do not typically present with abdominal distension at 3 months of age. Congenital pyloric obstruction typically presents with projectile vomiting at 2-3 weeks of age, not abdominal distension. Imperforate anus typically presents at birth with an abnormal anus or failure to pass meconium. Oesophageal atresia typically presents at birth with excessive salivation, coughing, and respiratory distress.

A 6 month old baby unable to support their own head

Rationale: A 6 month old baby should be able to support their own head when placed in a sitting position. This is a normal milestone of gross motor development. If a 6 month old baby is unable to support their own head, it could indicate a delay in gross motor development. 

A 3 month old baby not being able to roll from a supine to prone position is normal as this milestone is typically achieved around 4-5 months. A 2 week old baby showing head lag when being held is also normal as newborn babies do not have the strength to hold their heads up. A 9 month old who recently started attempting to crawl is also normal as this is a typical age for babies to start crawling. Pincer's grasp is a fine motor skill that develops around 9-12 months, so a 3 month old baby not having this skill is normal.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Increased cardiac output
B.  Elevated heart rate
C.  Increased blood pressure
D.  Increased blood volume

###Answer:",C,"Many changes take place during pregnancy, but blood pressure drops due to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

The cardiac output is increased due to an increased heart rate and blood volume.

There is also a drop in hematocrit due to an increase in plasma volume.

Cardiovascular system changes occurring during normal pregnancy include increases in cardiac output, arterial compliance, and extracellular fluid volume, and decreases in blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. Mean blood pressure falls during pregnancy, with the greatest decrease typically occurring at 16 to 20 weeks. Blood pressure rises during the mid-third trimester to levels approaching prepregnancy values.

She gives a history of irregular menstrual cycles followed by heavy bleeding per vagina for 5 months. She is multiparous with a history of 3 previous vaginal deliveries. The medical and surgical histories are noncontributory. The drug history is insignificant except for the use of over-the-counter herbal supplements. Her laboratory results show the presence of anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL (12-16 mg/dL) and serum estradiol of 1150 pg/mL (normal <500 pg/mL). What is the most appropriate next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Progesterone supplements and vaginal estrogens
B.  Iron supplements and hemostatic agents
C.  Pelvic computed tomography scan
D.  Transvaginal ultrasound
E.  Hormonal profile

###Answer:",D,"The patient has anemia due to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The cause of AUB and high serum estradiol levels needs to be evaluated. High levels of estrogens can cause endometrial hyperplasia and may be due to hormone-secreting ovarian tumors. A transvaginal ultrasound can provide information about the uterus, endometrial thickness, and ovarian pathology.

Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary are rare and seen mostly in adults. They are the sex cord-stromal tumors and secrete estrogen. The symptoms depend on the patient's age. In young girls, it can lead to precocious puberty, while menstrual symptoms are the most common presentation in reproductive-age women, and postmenopausal women present with bleeding.

Almost 40% of women with granulosa cell tumors can have endometrial hyperplasia due to the high levels of estrogen.

Over-the-counter herbal preparations can have high levels of estrogen, which can go unnoticed. Their composition needs to be checked meticulously as high estrogen levels can cause endometrial hyperplasia.",Progesterone supplements and vaginal estrogens,Iron supplements and hemostatic agents,Pelvic computed tomography scan,Transvaginal ultrasound,Hormonal profile,D,"D. Transvaginal ultrasound

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding, which is likely related to hormonal imbalance. The high serum estradiol level suggests that the bleeding is due to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium. The next step in management is to evaluate the uterus and endometrium with a transvaginal ultrasound to rule out any structural abnormalities, such as polyps or fibroids, that may be contributing to the bleeding. The ultrasound will also help assess the endometrial thickness, which can provide further information about the underlying cause of the bleeding.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is prostaglandin F2alpha. Primary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstrual cramps without any underlying medical condition. Elevated levels of prostaglandin F2alpha, a hormone-like substance, are associated with primary dysmenorrhea. Prostaglandin F2alpha is responsible for causing the uterus to contract, leading to menstrual cramps. Therefore, treatments for primary dysmenorrhea aim to reduce the levels of prostaglandin F2alpha in order to alleviate pain and discomfort during menstruation.",Estrogen,Progesterone,FSH,Prostaglandin F2alpha,Prostaglandin E2,D,"D

Rationale: Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by excessive production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2alpha, by the endometrium.

Rationale: Endometriosis is not a risk factor for cystocele formation. Cystocele is a type of pelvic organ prolapse that occurs when the bladder falls into the vagina due to weakened muscles and ligaments. The risk factors for cystocele formation include:

* Childbirth (especially multiple vaginal deliveries)
* Heavy lifting
* Repetitive straining for bowel movement
* Being overweight

Rationale: The second stage of labor is the period from full cervical dilatation to delivery of the baby. In primigravida (first-time mothers), the normal maximum time for the second stage of labor without anesthesia is about 2 hours (120 minutes).

He recently traveled to South America to meet a friend who is a farmer. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse 80/min, respirations 16/min, and temperature 98.0 F (36.7 C). On examination, the patient has a symmetric abdomen, with localized tenderness over the right upper quadrant on light and deep palpation, without rebound or guarding. CT scan reveals numerous cysts in the patients liver. Which of the following serious adverse effects is the patient at risk for developing?
###Options:
A.  Anaphylaxis
B.  Blindness
C.  Seizures
D.  Intestinal ulceration
E.  Severe Headaches

###Answer:",A,"This patient, with a 2-week history of pain in the right upper quadrant, swelling in the abdomen, and chest pain, who recently traveled to South America and was exposed to livestock, is most likely infected with Echinococcus granulosus. Echinococcus granulosus infections cause cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatidosis. Hydatidosis results from a larval infection of the tapeworm (cestode) Echinococcus granulosus. The disease characteristically demonstrates the growth of hydatid cysts (metacestode) in internal organs (including the liver) of intermediate hosts. The definitive hosts of the cestode are carnivores such as dogs. Humans and other hosts ingest eggs or gravid proglottids that are excreted in the definitive host's feces, causing the infection.

A serious adverse effect that may result from rupture hydatid cysts is anaphylaxis. Treatment for Echinococcus granulosus is the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) procedure. This procedure is an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive modality used in hepatic and other abdominal cysts. Indications include inoperable patients, relapsing cases after surgery, and failure to respond to medical treatment. It provides the best results in CE1, and CE3a cysts over 5cm and is used in combination with medical therapy (BMZ). It is contraindicated in for CE2, CE3b, CE4, and CE5 cysts. Physicians performing this procedure must be equipped to deal with the potential anaphylactic shock. Other percutaneous treatment can be used, but are usually reserved for CE2 and CE3b cysts.

In symptomatic patients, one has to remove the entire cyst without rupture. One should never attempt to aspirate hydatid cysts because of the risk of cyst rupture and anaphylaxis. Lung may have to be resected if the underlying parenchyma has been damaged. To kill cysts, one can instill hypertonic saline in the cyst at the time of enucleation.

In addition to the risk for anaphylaxis, the rupture of the cyst, whether spontaneous or traumatic, can cause site-specific complications. Rupture of liver cysts into the biliary tree can result in biliary obstruction, superinfection of the cyst, and secondary peritonitis, while rupture of the lung cysts into the bronchial tree can result in pneumonitis, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and secondary pleuritis.",Anaphylaxis,Blindness,Seizures,Intestinal ulceration,Severe Headaches,B,"B.

Rationale: The patient is at risk for developing blindness due to the risk of cysticercosis, which is caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium). The patient's recent travel to South America and his friend being a farmer increase the likelihood of exposure to contaminated food or water. Cysticercosis can cause cysts in the liver, as seen on the CT scan, as well as in the brain, eyes, and other organs.

D.  Lung cancer
E.  Tuberculosis

###Answer:",A,"He has a history of recent bisphosphonate use, which can lead to hypocalcemia in patients with subclinical hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is due to deficiency or impaired activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to decreased serum levels of calcium and increased levels of phosphorus.

Hypocalcemia can also occur with bisphosphonates. Its symptoms may include impaired sensations, muscle spasms, seizures, or cardiac arrest.

Severe hypocalcemia can manifest as seizures. It can lead to a positive Trousseau sign and a Chvostek sign. Chvostek sign is elicited by tapping the inferior portion of the cheekbone, which produces facial spasms.

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of seizures, altered sensorium, and bilateral facial muscle spasms are indicative of hypocalcemia. The patient's recent infusion of zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis, is likely the cause of the hypocalcemia. The patient's other symptoms, such as bradycardia, hypotension, and prolonged QT interval, are also consistent with hypocalcemia.

She is experiencing occasional low back pain and fatigue. The low back pain is constant in nature, and does not feel like contractions. On physical examination, she is in no acute distress and is afebrile, with a pulse of 76/min, blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 22/min. Fundal height is 34 cm. Pelvic examination reveals fluid in the vaginal canal. The patient comments that she noticed it, but wasnt worried because it wasnt bloody. She says she really is not sure if the fluid has any odor or not. She also denies any vaginal irritation. In addition to standard 3236 week testing (chlamydia and gonorrhea cultures, repeat hematocrit, and Group B streptococcal screening), a nitrazine blue test is performed; results are positive.

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. This patients presentation is consistent with both premature rupture of membranes and BV, given only the positive nitrazine paper test. Nitrazine tests nonspecifically for alkaline vaginal fluid, which may be amniotic fluid or the alkaline vaginal secretions associated with BV. At this point, no definite conclusion may be drawn. Further tests would include a wet mount in which case clue cells, or epithelial cells studded with bacteria, would be indicative of BV and evidence of ferning would suggest premature rupture of membranes. Although BV is normally associated with a foul odor, it is also notable for a lack of vaginal irritation, unlike other vaginoses.",This patient has candidiasis,This patient has placenta previa,This patient has normal vaginal secretions,This patient is in premature labor,This patient may have premature rupture of membranes or bacterial vaginosis,E,"E

Rationale: The nitrazine blue test is used to detect the presence of amniotic fluid in the vagina. It is based on the principle that amniotic fluid has a higher pH than normal vaginal secretions. When nitrazine blue is added to amniotic fluid, it turns blue, whereas it remains yellow or greenish in the presence of normal vaginal secretions. In this case, the test is positive, indicating that the fluid in the vaginal canal may be amniotic fluid (premature rupture of membranes) or it could be related to bacterial vaginosis, which also has a higher pH than normal vaginal secretions.",True,model6

His pulse is 125/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jaundice and visible blood vessels surrounding the umbilicus. CT scans of the abdomen are shown. To decrease portal venous pressure in this patient, it is most appropriate to place a shunt between the portal vein and which of the following additional vessels?
###Options:
A.  Inferior mesenteric vein
B.  Inferior vena cava
C.  Left gastric vein
D.  Splenic vein
E.  Superior mesenteric vein

###Answer:",C,"Based on the clinical presentation of vomiting bright red blood, signs of portal hypertension (jaundice, visible blood vessels surrounding the umbilicus), and the need to decrease portal venous pressure, the most appropriate vessel to place a shunt between the portal vein and is:(C) Left gastric vein",Inferior mesenteric vein,Inferior vena cava,Left gastric vein,Splenic vein,Superior mesenteric vein,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with bleeding esophageal varices, which is a complication of portal hypertension. The CT scan shows a large spleen and a dilated portal vein, further supporting this diagnosis. To decrease portal venous pressure, a portacaval shunt can be created between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava (option B). This shunt would divert blood flow from the portal vein to the inferior vena cava, reducing portal venous pressure and potentially stopping the bleeding. The other options are not correct because they do not provide a direct route to decrease portal venous pressure.",False,model6

###Answer:",A,"Polyps are the most common benign neoplasm of the cervix and endocervix. They are abnormal tissue growths that can occur in various parts of the body, including the cervix. They usually develop from the lining of the cervix and can cause abnormal bleeding or discharge. Polyps are typically non-cancerous and can be easily removed if necessary.

The most common benign neoplasm of the cervix and endocervix is a polyp. Cervical polyps are growths that occur on the surface of the cervix and are usually benign. They are often asymptomatic but may cause bleeding, especially after intercourse. They are more common in women over 40 years old. Nabothian cysts are small, benign cysts that occur on the surface of the cervix, but they are not neoplasms. Leiomyoma is a type of benign tumor that occurs in the smooth muscle of the uterus, not the cervix.

###Options:
A.  Insulin
B.  Glucagon
C.  Cortisol
D.  Thyroxine
E.  Growth hormone

Rationale: Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels in the body. It is produced by the pancreas and plays a crucial role in facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly muscle and adipose tissue, for energy production, glycogen synthesis, and fat storage. Insulin also inhibits glucose production in the liver and promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen.

###Options:
A.  Necrotising enterocolitis
B.  Situs inversus
C.  Cystic fibrosis
D.  Morgagni hernia
E.  Bochdalek hernia

###Answer:",E,"Bochdalek herniaA Bochdalek hernia is one of two forms of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the other form being Morgagni hernia. A Bochdalek hernia is a congenital abnormality in which an opening exists in the infants diaphragm, allowing normally intra-abdominal organs (particularly the stomach and intestines) to protrude into the thoracic cavity. In the majority of patients, the affected lung will be deformed, and the resulting lung compression can be life-threatening. Bochdalek hernias occur more commonly on the posterior left side (85%, versus right side 15%).In normal Bochdalek hernia cases, the symptoms are often observable simultaneously with the babys birth. A few of the symptoms of a Bochdalek Hernia include difficulty breathing, fast respiration and increased heart rate. Also, if the baby appears to have cyanosis (blue-tinted skin) this can also be a sign. Another way to differentiate a healthy baby from a baby with Bochdalek Hernia, is to look at the chest immediately after birth. If the baby has a Bochdalek Hernia it may appear that one side of the chest cavity is larger than the other and or the abdomen seems to be scaphoid (caved in).Situs inversus (also called situs transversus or oppositus) is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as situs solitus while situs inversus is generally the mirror image of situs solitus.",Necrotising enterocolitis,Situs inversus,Cystic fibrosis,Morgagni hernia,Bochdalek hernia,E,"E. Bochdalek hernia

Rationale: 
The symptoms described in the question, such as severe respiratory compromise, scaphoid abdomen, and an absent apex beat, are all indicative of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia, which occurs through a defect in the posterior aspect of the diaphragm. This defect allows abdominal contents to herniate into the chest cavity, leading to respiratory distress and other symptoms. The scaphoid abdomen is due to the absence of abdominal viscera in the abdominal cavity. The absent apex beat is due to the displacement of the heart by the herniated abdominal contents.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Epinephrine
B.  Fenoldopam
C.  Dobutamine
D.  Isoproterenol
E.  Dopamin

###Answer:",C,"Among the choices, the ideal drug to increase contractility of the heart in acute heart failure is dobutamine, since it is a selective ²1-adrenergic agonist. Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist used to treat severe hypertension. Other drugs are nonselective adrenergic agonists that could cause unwanted side effects",Epinephrine,Fenoldopam,Dobutamine,Isoproterenol,Dopamin,C,"C

Rationale: Dobutamine is a beta-agonist that increases cardiac contractility and heart rate, which can help improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. It is the most appropriate choice among the options given. Epinephrine is a strong alpha-agonist that can increase peripheral resistance, which may worsen cardiac output. Fenoldopam is a dopamine receptor agonist that is used to reduce blood pressure, not to improve cardiac function. Isoproterenol is a beta-agonist that can increase heart rate, but it may also increase peripheral vasodilation, which may worsen hypotension. Dopamine can increase cardiac contractility, but it also has alpha-agonist effects that can increase peripheral resistance, which may worsen cardiac output.",True,model6

B.  Individuals over 50 who undergo splenectomy face the highest risk of postsplenectomy sepsis.
C.  Vaccination should be administered two weeks post-splenectomy.
D.  The likelihood of infection post-splenectomy rises over time.
E.  Staphylococcus aureus is the primary organism associated with postsplenectomy sepsis.

###Answer:",A,"Splenectomy increases the likelihood of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, a severe infection with a high mortality rate. The main culprits are encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and occasionally gram-negative enteric organisms. Viral infections do not pose an elevated risk. Vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis is recommended for all potential splenectomy candidates, ideally administered at least 2 weeks before surgery. Younger patients, under 20 years old, face the highest risk due to the spleen's role in primary immunity and their increased exposure to these organisms.

Rationale: Elective splenectomy carries a heightened risk of postsplenectomy sepsis, particularly in individuals over 50 years of age. The risk is highest in the first two years following splenectomy, but it remains elevated lifelong. Vaccination against encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis should be administered two weeks prior to splenectomy.

###Answer:",D," The correct answer is D. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is a cause of type B, or antral dominant, chronic gastritis. The most common cause of chronic type B gastritis is use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but our patient lacks this history. The incidence of chronic gastritis increases with age and the histologic appearance improves with the treatment of H. pylori. Symptoms of chronic gastritis may include pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, this condition is frequently asymptomatic. Diagnosis is confirmed by H. pylori antibody test and breath urease test, as well as a direct gastric biopsy and culture. Treatment of H. pylori gastritis is with triple therapy, which includes two antibiotics (metronidazole and clarithromycin), bismuth compound, and a proton pump inhibitor. Type A gastritis is autoimmune-mediated, affecting the fundus, and is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.",Alcohol abuse,Cigarette smoking,Iatrogenic,Infection,Spicy foods,D,"D. Infection

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings are consistent with gastritis, specifically antral gastritis. The most common cause of antral gastritis is Helicobacter pylori infection.

He notes that he has had previous wounds at this location, which have healed in the past, but this one has not. He denies systemic symptoms but admits having trouble getting around, as his feet and lower legs get painful with walking. On physical exam, there is rubor less than 2 cm around the border, trace serous drainage in the wound, a fibrotic base, and a thickened, raised border, and the area is tender to palpation. There is limited bleeding on debridement due to the fibrotic base's thickened nature. The patient's pulse is faint, and the skin on the feet is atrophic and dry. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment following this appointment?
###Options:
A.  Referral for diabetic management and follow-up blood glucose
B.  Weekly wound care with debridements, wound vac placement, and biological skin substitute placement

E.  Antibiotics

###Answer:",C,"While the patient has not been well controlled in their diabetic management, which may be the cause of their nonhealing wound, the immediate concern is the vascular status.

The patient has been treated with conservative measures, which, though rudimentary, should have likely shown some improvement over time. Therefore, there is likely an underlying problem that has yet to be addressed. More advanced wound care modalities may provide the necessary environment for healing, but if the vascular issue is not addressed, they will likely fail.

The history includes MI, generally caused by atherosclerosis, which can also manifest in the extremities. The complaint of pain with walking and claudication suggests impaired vascular supply.

A wound biopsy may be indicated after the vascular disease is ruled out since chronic nonhealing wounds sometimes indicate malignancy.",Referral for diabetic management and follow-up blood glucose,"Weekly wound care with debridements, wound vac placement, and biological skin substitute placement",Vascular workup with arterial Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index,Wound punch biopsy to be sent for pathology,Antibiotics,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest peripheral artery disease (PAD) as a major contributor to the wound's failure to heal. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and previous myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of PAD. The faint pulse, atrophic and dry skin on the feet, and painful lower legs with walking further support this diagnosis. A vascular workup, including arterial Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index, is necessary to assess the patient's arterial blood flow and determine the extent of PAD. This information will guide further treatment, including the possibility of revascularization procedures. While wound care, diabetic management, and biopsy may be necessary, addressing the underlying PAD is the most critical next step in treating the wound.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Constitutional delay in growth
B.  Genetic short stature
C.  Primordial dwarfism
D.  Hypopituitarism
E.  All of the above

###Answer:",A,The growth velocity and height for age in early childhood will be lower than normal in case of constitutional growth delay. But the final height attained will be normal. The skeletal maturation will be lower than expected for age.,Constitutional delay in growth,Genetic short stature,Primordial dwarfism,Hypopituitarism,All of the above,A,"A

Rationale: 

The given information suggests that the child has a normal growth velocity but is short for his age. The fact that his skeletal age is less than his chronological age indicates that his bones are younger than his actual age, which is a characteristic feature of constitutional delay in growth. This is a normal variant of growth and development, where the growth spurt is delayed, but eventually, the child will reach his genetic potential. In genetic short stature, the growth velocity is normal, but the skeletal age is consistent with the chronological age. In primordial dwarfism, the growth velocity is decreased, and the skeletal age is consistent with the chronological age. Hypopituitarism would result in a decreased growth velocity.",True,model6

Rationale: Paradoxical breathing is a type of breathing pattern that occurs when a segment of the chest wall moves in the opposite direction of the rest of the chest wall. This can occur due to a flail chest, which is a type of injury that occurs when a segment of the chest wall breaks away from the rest of the chest cage, typically due to multiple fractures of more than one rib. This causes the broken segment to move inward during inspiration and outward during expiration, which is the opposite of the normal movement of the chest wall.

Rationale: Retroplacental abruption is a type of placental abruption where the placenta separates from the uterus, causing bleeding behind the placenta. The most common clinical presentation of retroplacental abruption is painful bleeding with contractions. This is because the bleeding causes irritation of the uterine muscle, leading to contractions. The pain is usually sudden in onset and severe, and it may be accompanied by a hard, tender uterus. The bleeding may not always be visible, as it can be concealed behind the placenta. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Ribavirin.
B.  Oseltamivir.
C.  Zanamivir.
D.  Rimantadine.
E.  Amantadine

###Answer:",B,"Oseltamivir is the best choice since it is administered orally and not associated with resistance. Zanamivir is administered via inhalation and is not recommended for patients with underlying COPD. High rates of resistance have developed to adamantanes (amantadine, rimantadine), and these drugs are infrequently indicated. Ribavirin is not indicated for treatment of influenza",Ribavirin.,Oseltamivir.,Zanamivir.,Rimantadine.,Amantadine,B,"B

Rationale: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is effective against both influenza A and B viruses. It is most appropriate for this patient because it can be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, and it has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of influenza symptoms. Ribavirin is an antiviral agent used to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis C, but it is not effective against influenza. Zanamivir (Relenza) is also a neuraminidase inhibitor, but it is administered by inhalation and may not be suitable for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rimantadine and amantadine are adamantanes that are effective against influenza A, but they are not recommended due to high levels of resistance.",True,model6

Initially, the genital lesions were painful ulcers. They healed quickly but have increased in number. A review of systems is negative for sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, loose stools, or burning micturition. Her vital signs are blood pressure 130/75 mm Hg, heart rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 15 breaths/min, and temperature 99 °F (37.2 °C). A physical examination reveals a widespread macular rash, which is present on her palms and soles. She also has multiple smooth, flat-topped, flesh-colored lesions in the anogenital area, which are painless. The joint exam is unremarkable. Laboratory test results are WBC 7,000/¼L, hemoglobin 12 gm/dL, platelets 175,000/¼L, serum ALT 66 IU/L, serum AST 75 IU/L, serum ALP 220 IU/L, serum albumin 4.0 g/dL, serum sodium 142 mEq/L, serum potassium 4.2 mEq/L, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, and CRP 75 mg/L.

###Options:
A.  Bowenoid papulosis
B.  Condyloma accuminata
C.  Molluscum contagiosum
D.  Condyloma lata
E.  Clamydia

###Answer:",D,"This patient has presented with constitutional symptoms and a skin rash. The presence of the rash on palms and soles, along with a positive VDRL test, suggests secondary syphilis as the diagnosis. Secondary syphilis is associated with peri-anal lesions called condyloma lata. Anogenital lesions that appear during primary syphilis are painful but heal quickly. 

Condyloma latum is seen in about 10% to 45% of cases of syphilis. They are usually smooth, flat-topped, moist lesions in the peri-anal region. Treatment with benzathine penicillin for syphilis leads to the resolution of condyloma lata. 

Histologically, these lesions demonstrate epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis, and dermal inflammatory infiltrate. The infiltrate usually comprises lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Human papillomavirus causes anogenital warts, which are bulky, white, and verrucous and are called condyloma accuminata. Molluscum contagiosum can cause perianal lesions but are dome-shaped with central umbilication. Bowenoid papulosis is another skin condition caused by Human papillomavirus characterized by cutaneous pigmented papules.",Bowenoid papulosis,Condyloma accuminata,Molluscum contagiosum,Condyloma lata,Clamydia,D,"D.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with fever, body aches, and a non-itchy rash, which is consistent with a viral syndrome. The presence of genital lesions, which initially were painful ulcers but healed quickly, and the subsequent appearance of multiple smooth, flat-topped, flesh-colored lesions in the anogenital area, which are painless, suggests a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. The rash on the palms and soles, which is present in this patient, is a characteristic feature of secondary syphilis. The positive VDRL test supports this diagnosis. The condyloma lata are the characteristic skin lesions seen in secondary syphilis, which are flat, moist, and usually occur on the genitalia or anorectal area.

He has been feeling unwell for the past 3 weeks, with fevers, headaches and tiredness. His mother is concerned that he has been getting worse over time instead of better. He looks very pale and has many bruises and petechiae on his arms and legs, which have appeared spontaneously over the past week. Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged liver and spleen. An urgent full blood count shows: haemoglobin 68g/L (normal 120-180), platelets 25 (normal 150-450), white cell count 83 (normal 3.4-11.0). What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?
###Options:
A.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
B.  Aplastic anaemia
C.  Epstein-Barr virus
D.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
E.  Lymphoma

###Answer:",A,"This is a presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This boy is anaemic and thrombocytopenic, which together suggests a problem in the bone marrow. The high white cell count, fevers, headaches and hepatosplenomegaly point towards leukaemia. Aplastic anaemia would cause a low white cell count. ITP would cause low platelets, but the boy would otherwise be well. Although lymphoma could cause a high WCC, lymphadenopathy would be expected. Epstein-Barr virus could cause many of the boys symptoms, but would generally cause lymphadenopathy too and not anaemia or thrombocytopenia",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Aplastic anaemia,Epstein-Barr virus,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Lymphoma,A,"A.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Rationale: The symptoms and signs described in this case, including fever, headaches, tiredness, pallor, bruising and petechiae, are all consistent with a diagnosis of acute leukaemia. The full blood count results show a low haemoglobin, low platelet count, and a very high white cell count, which is also consistent with this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of an enlarged liver and spleen also support this diagnosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood leukaemia, and it typically presents with symptoms and signs similar to those described in this case. While the other options could potentially cause some of the symptoms and signs described, they are less likely to cause the full range of symptoms and signs described, and are not as consistent with the full blood count results.",True,model6

E.  Mitral stenosis

###Answer:",A,The correct answer is A. A flow murmur is almost universal in advanced pregnancy.,A benign flow murmur,Aortic stenosis,Atrial septal defect,Aortic regurgitation,Mitral stenosis,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient is a 35-year-old pregnant woman with a BMI of 40, which makes her more susceptible to benign flow murmurs. The presence of a grade III/VI murmur along the mid left sternal edge without any other cardiorespiratory signs further supports this diagnosis.

###Options:
A.  Ascending colon
B.  Distal ileum
C.  Distal jejunum
D.  Proximal ileum
E.  Proximal jejunum

###Answer:",E,"Given the patient's clinical presentation of acute severe abdominal pain and the findings of an embolus in the superior mesenteric artery, she likely has acute mesenteric ischemia. This condition results from inadequate blood flow to the small intestine, leading to ischemia and potential infarction of the affected bowel segments.In acute mesenteric ischemia, the segment of the bowel supplied by the affected artery (in this case, the superior mesenteric artery) becomes ischemic. The location of the embolus, just beyond the patent middle colic artery, suggests that the proximal portions of the small intestine (jejunum) may be affected, particularly the proximal jejunum.Therefore, during the laparotomy, the most likely segment of the abdominal viscera to appear normal is:(E) Proximal jejunum",Ascending colon,Distal ileum,Distal jejunum,Proximal ileum,Proximal jejunum,A,"A

Rationale: 
The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies the small intestine from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum, but not the ascending colon. The ascending colon is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Therefore, in a case of embolism of the SMA, the ascending colon would be the least affected and would likely appear normal.",False,model6

Explanation:

B. FEV1 post-bronchodilator: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) post-bronchodilator is a key measurement in confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Asthma is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. A decrease in FEV1 indicates bronchoconstriction, which is typical in asthma.

Rationale: The diagnosis of asthma is confirmed by demonstrating reversible airflow obstruction. The most commonly used test for this purpose is spirometry, which measures forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). A significant increase in FEV1 (at least 12%) after administration of a bronchodilator, such as albuterol, is diagnostic of asthma. This is known as a positive bronchodilator response.

###Options:
A.  Graves' disease
B.  Thyroid cancer
C.  Thyroid storm
D.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis

###Answer:",A,"Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, also known as thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) or thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb). These antibodies mimic the action of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and bind to and activate the TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells, leading to excessive production and secretion of thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine). This results in hyperthyroidism and diffuse thyroid enlargement, known as a goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, on the other hand, is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication of severe hyperthyroidism characterized by exaggerated symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid cancer refers to malignant growths in the thyroid gland and is not primarily an autoimmune disorder.",Graves' disease,Thyroid cancer,Thyroid storm,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,,A,"A

Rationale: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) that bind to and activate the TSH receptor, leading to hyperthyroidism and diffuse thyroid enlargement.

C.  tenderness
D.  boggy uterus

###Answer:",D,A boggy uterus is more indicative of adenomyosis,"Fixed, retroverted uterus",uterosacral ligament nodules,tenderness,boggy uterus,,D,"D. boggy uterus

Rationale: 
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. On bimanual examination, common features of endometriosis include:
- A fixed, retroverted uterus (option A): This is due to adhesions between the uterus and surrounding structures.
- Uterosacral ligament nodules (option B): These are palpable nodules or thickening of the uterosacral ligaments, which can be tender.
- Tenderness (option C): Many women with endometriosis experience pelvic pain and tenderness on palpation of the uterus, adnexa, or surrounding structures.

However, a boggy uterus (option D) is not a common feature of endometriosis. A boggy uterus is typically seen in cases of uterine fibroids or adenomyosis, where the uterus is enlarged and has a soft, spongy texture.",True,model6

Rationale: The pituitary gland is often referred to as the ""master gland"" because it plays a crucial role in regulating various endocrine functions in the body. However, it is not entirely autonomous and is itself controlled by the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that lies above the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus produces and secretes several releasing and inhibiting hormones that stimulate or inhibit the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. These hormones, in turn, regulate the production of hormones from other endocrine glands such as the thyroid, adrenals, and gonads. Therefore, the correct answer is the hypothalamus.",True,model6

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, and neck stiffness, suggest meningitis. The presence of a petechial rash on the trunk is also consistent with meningitis. The history of a recent tick bite and the presence of a petechial rash suggest Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), which is a tick-borne illness that can cause meningitis. RMSF is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and is transmitted through the bite of an infected American dog tick. It typically presents with fever, headache, and a rash that begins as a maculopapular rash and progresses to a petechial rash. While Lyme disease is also a tick-borne illness, it typically presents with a characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans, which is not described in this patient. Tick-borne relapsing fever is a bacterial infection that causes recurring episodes of fever, but it is not typically associated with a petechial rash.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a benign ovarian cyst. The one-sided pain, normal menses, and lack of fever suggest a non-inflammatory process. The pelvic examination reveals a smooth, mobile adnexal mass, which is consistent with an ovarian cyst. Pelvic inflammatory disease (A) would typically present with bilateral pain, fever, and abnormal cervical discharge. Ectopic pregnancy (B) would typically present with a positive pregnancy test and more severe, acute pain.

A.  Catalase-positive, gram-negative cocobacilli
B.  Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters
C.  Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters
D.  Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a soft tissue infection, likely cellulitis or abscess formation, around the puncture wound. The presence of fever with shaking chills, lethargy, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot are indicative of systemic involvement, suggesting a more severe infection.Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease, they are at an increased risk of infections due to impaired immune function and compromised blood flow to tissues, which can predispose them to complications such as osteomyelitis or septicemia.The characteristic warm, swollen, and extremely tender area around the wound suggests a bacterial infection, and the likely causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that commonly causes skin and soft tissue infections. The presence of coagulase, an enzyme that enables the bacterium to form clots, helps in its identification. Staphylococcus aureus typically appears as gram-positive cocci in clusters on Gram stain, hence the correct option is c) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters.This explanation aligns with the clinical presentation and common microbiological characteristics associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections.","Catalase-positive, gram-negative cocobacilli","Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli",none,A,"A

E.  All of the above

###Answer:",B,"Suppression of the HPA axis usually occurs with higher doses of corticosteroids when used for a duration of 2 weeks or more. Although the dose of prednisone is higher in the asthma patient, the duration of therapy is short, so the risk of HPA axis suppression is lower.

Rationale: 
The patient taking 10 mg of prednisone daily for 3 months for rheumatoid arthritis (Option B) would most likely have suppression of the HPA axis and require a slow taper of corticosteroid therapy. This is because the prolonged duration of therapy (3 months) and the moderate dose of prednisone (10 mg) would likely suppress the HPA axis, leading to adrenal insufficiency if the medication were to be abruptly discontinued.

In contrast, the patient taking 40 mg of prednisone daily for 7 days to treat an asthma exacerbation (Option A) would not likely have significant suppression of the HPA axis, as the duration of therapy is relatively short.

The patient using mometasone nasal spray daily for 6 months for allergic rhinitis (Option C) would not likely have significant suppression of the HPA axis, as the dose of corticosteroid is relatively low and localized to the nasal mucosa.

The patient receiving an intra-articular injection of methylprednisolone for osteoarthritis (Option D) would not likely have significant suppression of the HPA axis, as the dose of corticosteroid is localized to the joint and would not have a significant systemic effect.

Rationale: 
The most likely causative organism in this context is Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is a 5-year-old child presenting with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and the chest X-ray shows bilateral pneumonia. This presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Staphylococcal pneumonia, which is a common cause of bilateral pneumonia in children.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain, along with the presence of bilateral ovarian cysts on ultrasound, suggest a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the upper female genital tract that can cause bilateral ovarian cysts, as well as symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and vaginal discharge. The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings. Ectopic pregnancy would typically present with vaginal bleeding and a positive pregnancy test, ovarian cancer is typically seen in older women and would not typically present with bilateral ovarian cysts, endometriosis is a chronic condition that would not typically cause bilateral ovarian cysts, and tubo-ovarian abscess is a complication of PID that would typically present with more severe symptoms such as high fever, chills, and severe abdominal pain.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,"Metolazone can cause hyperuricemia. Serum uric acid levels should be monitored, especially in patients with a history of hyperuricemia.

Blood pressure, electrolytes, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine should be monitored in patients taking metolazone.

While thiazide diuretics often are used as first-line therapy for hypertension, diuretic resistance occurs, failing to reduce extracellular fluid volume. Combination therapy of furosemide and metolazone has proved to be more efficacious.

The patient's lipid profile, heart rate, and creatine kinase do not require monitoring while taking metolazone.",Uric acid,Lipid profile,Ejection fraction,Creatine kinase,serum potassium level,E,"E

Rationale: Metolazone is a diuretic that can cause potassium depletion. The patient is already taking spironolactone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic.

Rationale: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. It promotes glycogen breakdown and glucose release from the liver, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. This is in contrast to insulin, which promotes glucose uptake and storage in the liver and muscles, thereby decreasing blood glucose levels.

###Answer:",E,") In serous cystadenocarcinoma, more than three cell layers of stratification exist in the epithelial cell lining. The individual cells are atypical, and there is invasion of the ovarian stroma and/or protrusion from the capsule (excrescences). A borderline malignant tumor has three or fewer cells in the lining of the cyst and no evidence of invasion.

Rationale: 
The description of numerous cysts lined by serous epithelium with marked cytologic atypia, and nests of similar cells in the ovarian stroma, indicates a borderline ovarian tumor. The presence of round laminated calcium bodies, known as psammoma bodies, is a characteristic feature of serous tumors.

Rationale: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are known to cause cardiac toxicity, particularly ventricular arrhythmias, which is the most common cause of death following TCA ingestion. TCAs can prolong the QT interval, leading to torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. The anticholinergic effects of TCAs can also cause tachycardia, which can further exacerbate the cardiac toxicity. Other options are not directly related to TCA toxicity.",True,model6

FS can be either hereditary or acquired; hereditary forms are typically secondary to genetic abnormalities such as cystinosis, galactosemia, Wilson disease, and some mitochondrial disorders. Various agents can also cause FS, including certain medications like gentamicin, outdated tetracycline, cephalothin, cidofovir, valproic acid, streptozocin, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cisplatin, ifosfamide, as well as exposure to heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, cadmium, uranium, platinum), paraquat, maleic acid, and inhalation of glue (toluene). These agents exert their effects through mechanisms such as acute tubular necrosis, alteration of renal blood flow, intratubular obstruction, or allergic reactions within the kidney. Many of these toxic effects can be reduced or eliminated by discontinuing the offending agent.Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1, known as distal RTA, and type 4 both exhibit a positive urine anion gap, unlike type 3, which is not a recognized subtype of RTA.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of Hirschsprung disease. The delay in passage of the first stool, chronic constipation, and absence of diarrhea or fecal soiling are all indicative of this condition. Rectal manometry and barium enema are the next steps in the evaluation to rule out Hirschsprung disease. Rectal manometry can assess the rectal pressure and anal sphincter tone, and barium enema can evaluate for the presence of a transition zone, which is diagnostic of Hirschsprung disease. Stimulant laxatives may be used to treat constipation, but they are not the next step in the evaluation of this patient.

1.  The mother is exclusively breastfeeding (i.e., the baby is not supplemented with formula or other foods).
2.  The baby is less than 6 months old.
3.  The mother is amenorrheic (has not resumed menstruating).

Breastfeeding inhibits the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn inhibits the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

E.  None of the above

###Answer:",C,"Normal hemoglobin is composed predominantly of HbA1  which is composed of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains. In beta thalassemia trait, there is decrease in production of beta chains of hemoglobin. But since the defect is minor, they will not have any clinical features and the peripheral smear may be normal. But there will be a compensatory increase in HbA2 which is composed of 2 alpha chains and 2 delta chains. Normally HbA2 constitutes about 1.5 to 3.5% of total hemoglobin. But in beta thalassemia trait, this increases to about 3.6 to 8%",HbF,HbA1c,HbA2,HbH,None of the above,C,"C

Rationale: In beta thalassemia trait, there is a defect in the production of beta globin chains. As a result, there is an increase in the production of alpha globin chains, which combine with delta globin chains to form HbA2. Therefore, HbA2 levels are elevated in beta thalassemia trait, typically above 3.5%. This is a diagnostic feature of beta thalassemia trait and helps to distinguish it from iron deficiency anemia, which can have similar clinical and hematological features. HbF is elevated in beta thalassemia major, not in beta thalassemia trait. HbA1c is a measure of glycated hemoglobin and is not relevant to thalassemia. HbH is a tetramer of beta globin chains and is not relevant to beta thalassemia.",True,model6

She admits to a few bouts of binge drinking in her 20sbut denies having any alcoholic beverages over the past 30 years.Because she has heard that alcohol use can reduce heart disease,she would like to know if she should drink a few glasses of wine everynight.Which of the following is the most appropriate response?
###Options:
A.  Advise the patient not to begin alcohol consumption
B.  Advise the patient to consume 1-2 alcoholic beverages daily
C.  Advise the patient to consume 3-4 alcoholic beverages daily
D.  Advise the patient to consume at least 3 alcoholic beverages at a time, but only on weekends

###Answer:",A,"Available data suggest an association between regular, moderate (1-2 drinks/daily)alcohol consumption and lower rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-causemortality. In addition, regular, moderate alcohol intake may be associated with lowerlevels of coronary calcification, reduced postprandial glucose, and less incidentdiabetes mellitus. However, less frequent and higher levels of alcohol use appear toreverse these trends. For this reason, answers C and D are incorrect.Whether patients who do not currently use alcohol should begin to do so remainscontroversial. At present, there are insufficient data to justify a universalrecommendation for initiating alcohol consumption in nondrinking patients and thelatest AHA guidelines discourage this, in part because of the risk of dependence andpotential adverse consequences of alcohol intoxication. For this reason, in light ofthis patient's history of smoking and depression, the most prudent course isprobably for her to remain abstinent of alcohol use.",Advise the patient not to begin alcohol consumption,Advise the patient to consume 1-2 alcoholic beverages daily,Advise the patient to consume 3-4 alcoholic beverages daily,"Advise the patient to consume at least 3 alcoholic beverages at a time, but only on weekends",,A,"A.

###Answer:",C,The heart rate increases during pregnancy to meet the increased metabolic demands of both the mother and the fetus which augments cardiac output.Other factors that contribute to increase in CO in pregnancy are:-Increase in blood volume-Increase in stroke volume-Decrease in systemic vascular resistance,Decrease in blood volume,Increase in ejection fraction,Increases in heart rate,Increase in left ventricular stroke work index,Increase in systemic vascular resistance,C,"C

Rationale: 
During pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 30-50% due to various factors. The main contributors to this increase are:
- Increase in heart rate (option C): Heart rate increases by 10-20 beats per minute due to increased sympathetic tone and decreased vagal tone.
- Increase in stroke volume (not mentioned in the options): Stroke volume increases due to increased ventricular preload and contractility.
- Decrease in systemic vascular resistance (not mentioned in the options): Systemic vascular resistance decreases due to vasodilation and increased blood flow to the uterus and placenta.

The other options are incorrect:
- Option A: Blood volume increases during pregnancy, not decreases.
- Option B: Ejection fraction is not a direct contributor to the increase in cardiac output during pregnancy.

There is also clinical evidence of poor peripheral perfusion. What is the diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
B.  Intussusception
C.  Sickle cell crisis
D.  Henoch Schönlein purpura
E.  Appendicitis

###Answer:",A,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitisThe presence of periorbital and facial oedema with normal blood pressure in this toddler indicates that he has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individuals health and quality of life:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid  an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/µL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult. Delay of diagnosis can delay antifungal treatment and lead to a higher mortality rate.",Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Intussusception,Sickle cell crisis,Henoch Schönlein purpura,Appendicitis,N,"None of the above

###Answer:",C,"ADH is unique in that its release is primarily regulated by the hypothalamus, specifically the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. These nuclei produce ADH in response to changes in blood osmolality and blood volume. ADH is then stored and released by the posterior pituitary gland. However, the release of ADH is ultimately controlled by negative feedback mechanisms, where changes in blood osmolality or volume trigger either the release or inhibition of ADH production. Therefore, while the pituitary gland indirectly influences ADH release, it is not directly regulated by the anterior or posterior pituitary gland as the other hormones listed are.",Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH),Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH),Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH),Luteinizing Hormone (LH),,D,"D.  Luteinizing Hormone (LH)

Rationale: 
The correct answer is none of the above. The correct answer is cortisol. Cortisol is not directly regulated by the pituitary gland but indirectly influences its activity through negative feedback mechanisms. Cortisol is produced by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. It then exerts negative feedback on the pituitary gland to decrease ACTH production.

FSH, TSH, and LH are all directly regulated by the pituitary gland. ADH is also produced by the pituitary gland, but it is not a hormone that is directly regulated by the pituitary gland in the classical sense. Instead, it is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland.",False,model6

The varicella vaccine can be administered safely to a patient who lives with a pregnant woman. The risk of a post-vaccination rash is very low. Isolation from a pregnant patient is unnecessary unless the vaccinated patient develops a rash.

Delaying vaccines until after pregnancy is not recommended as vaccines make it less likely that a child will contract the disease and bring it home to the mother. Infection with wild-type varicella and rubella poses a far more significant threat to a pregnant woman.

Pregnant women should not receive live virus vaccines, but their household members should get all routine immunizations on schedule.",Administer all the scheduled vaccines.,Administer all vaccines except the varicella vaccine.,Defer all the scheduled vaccines until the mother delivers.,Administer inactivated polio vaccine only.,,A,"A.  Administer all the scheduled vaccines.

Rationale: The patient is 12 months old and is scheduled to receive measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, inactivated poliovirus, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations. There is no contraindication to administering these vaccines, including the varicella vaccine, even though the mother is pregnant. The varicella vaccine is not a live vaccine that can be transmitted to the fetus, so it is safe to administer. Therefore, the best next step in management is to administer all the scheduled vaccines.",True,model6

On auscultation of the praecordium, there was wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound. What is the likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Ventricular septal defect
B.  Tetralogy of Fallot

D.  Atrial septal defect
E.  Biscuspid valve

###Answer:",D,"Based on the clinical findings of wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound on auscultation, the likely diagnosis is:

D. Atrial septal defect",Ventricular septal defect,Tetralogy of Fallot,Patent ductus arteriosus,Atrial septal defect,Biscuspid valve,D,"D.  Atrial septal defect

Rationale: Wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound is a characteristic feature of atrial septal defect. In this condition, the second heart sound is split into two components, one for each atrium. The splitting is wide because the right atrium contracts and closes the pulmonary valve slightly after the left atrium closes the aortic valve. The splitting is fixed because it is not affected by inspiration or expiration.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"The priority should be to update vaccinations first, then other things follow ",Assess growth and development,Begin dental care,complete hearing screening,update vaccinations,,D,"D. update vaccinations

Rationale: 
The priority of care for this 3-year-old child is to update vaccinations. The child has not been seen since 6 months of age, which means the child has missed multiple vaccinations and is at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccinations are a crucial aspect of preventive care, and it is essential to ensure the child is up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations. While assessing growth and development, beginning dental care, and completing hearing screening are all important aspects of well-child care, they are not as critical as updating vaccinations in this situation.",True,model6

It is an important component of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies.",Hand hygiene,Condom use,Oral antibiotics,Isolation procedures,Wearing of gloves,B,"B

Rationale: Condom use is an effective method of preventing the transmission of HIV, as it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids between sexual partners. While hand hygiene, wearing of gloves, and isolation procedures are important infection control measures, they are not specifically targeted at preventing HIV transmission. Oral antibiotics are not a method of preventing HIV transmission.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a malodorous vaginal discharge that is often white or gray in color. It does not typically cause itching or irritation. The presence of clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria, is a characteristic finding in bacterial vaginosis. The absence of cervical motion tenderness and vaginal erythema also support this diagnosis. Candidal vaginitis and trichomonas vaginalis can cause similar symptoms but would typically present with different physical examination findings.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with bacterial vaginosis (BV). The presence of a malodorous, white, homogenous discharge that does not adhere to the vaginal walls, without vaginal erythema or itching, suggests BV. The presence of clue cells on a normal saline preparation further supports this diagnosis. Clue cells are epithelial cells that are coated with bacteria, which are typically seen in BV. Candidal vaginitis would typically present with a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge that adheres to the vaginal walls, often accompanied by itching and irritation. Trichomonas vaginalis would typically present with a yellow-green, frothy discharge, often accompanied by itching and irritation.

###Options:
A.  Insulin
B.  Glucagon
C.  Cortisol
D.  Thyroxine

###Answer:",B,"Glucagon is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas and acts to increase blood glucose levels. It does this by stimulating glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose) in the liver and promoting gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources). Insulin (option a) acts to lower blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake into cells and storage as glycogen. Cortisol (option c) is involved in stress response and metabolism, but its primary role in glucose metabolism is to promote gluconeogenesis. Thyroxine (option d) is a thyroid hormone that regulates metabolism but does not have a direct role in glucose regulation. ",Insulin,Glucagon,Cortisol,Thyroxine,,B,"B

Rationale: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. It does this by stimulating glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen to glucose) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) in the liver. This results in an increase in blood glucose levels, which helps to counteract hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Insulin, on the other hand, has the opposite effect, promoting glucose uptake and storage in tissues. Cortisol and thyroxine are hormones produced by the adrenal glands and thyroid gland, respectively, and while they have some effects on glucose metabolism, they are not primarily responsible for regulating blood glucose levels.",True,model6

What other findings can be seen with this condition?
###Options:
A.  Zenker diverticulum
B.  Mallory Weiss tear
C.  Esophageal varices
D.  Esophageal web
E.  Diverticulitis

###Answer:",D,"Plummer-Vinson Syndrome (PVS) presents as a classical triad of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia, and esophageal web. It is a rare medical condition and primarily affects women in the age group of 40 to 70.

It has been postulated that iron deficiency induces iron-dependent enzyme dysfunction, leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage in the epithelia of the esophageal mucosa. Repeated injury to epithelia due to iron deficiency leads to atrophy of mucosa and degradation of pharyngeal muscles, leading to the development of esophageal webs.

Although PVS is a rare diagnosis, there should be high clinical suspicion in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, one or more esophageal webs, and post-cricoid dysphagia.

Esophageal webs need to be dilated endoscopically. Typically used techniques include endoscopic balloon dilatation or Savary-Gilliard dilators. Therapeutic endoscopy denotes the rupture of the web with a small amount of fresh blood at the site of the web.",Zenker diverticulum,Mallory Weiss tear,Esophageal varices,Esophageal web,Diverticulitis,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and history of iron deficiency anemia are consistent with the diagnosis of Plummer-Vinson syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by dysphagia, iron deficiency anemia, and esophageal webs. The esophageal web is a thin, mucosal fold that can cause mechanical obstruction of the esophagus, leading to dysphagia.

Rationale: The emission phase of the sexual act involves the sympathetic nervous system. Emission is a sympathetic response that occurs in the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland. The neurotransmitter involved in this response is norepinephrine. An inhibitor of beta-adrenergic nervous system receptors, such as propranolol, would block the sympathetic response and interfere with the emission phase.",True,model6

Despite normal findings on rectal examination, he continues to vomit blood in the emergency room, prompting the placement of an artificial airway and the initiation of fluid resuscitation.
###Options:
A.  Gastric ulcer
B.  Gastric antral vascular lesion
C.  Esophageal varices
D.  Duodenal ulcer
E.  MalloryWeiss tear

###Answer:",C,"The probable cause of this substantial upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is esophageal varices resulting from portal hypertension. While MalloryWeiss tears are frequently observed in young patients who experience retching and vomiting, the history and severity of bleeding in this case make it less likely. Although bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers could manifest similarly, they are uncommon in young individuals without additional health issues.",Gastric ulcer,Gastric antral vascular lesion,Esophageal varices,Duodenal ulcer,MalloryWeiss tear,E,"E.

Rationale: 
The patient's presentation with hematemesis, especially after a night of heavy drinking, is consistent with a Mallory-Weiss tear. This is a longitudinal laceration in the gastric mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction, which can occur after forceful vomiting or retching. The patient's signs of chronic liver disease and hypotension also support this diagnosis. While esophageal varices (C) are also a possibility, the patient's history of recent heavy drinking and vomiting makes a Mallory-Weiss tear more likely.

###Options:
A.  Continue once-daily administration of isosorbide  mononitrate but advise the patient to take this  medication in the evening.
B.  Advise continuation of isosorbide mononitrate  twice daily for full 24-hour coverage of anginal  symptoms.

D.  Switch to nitroglycerin patch for consistent drug  delivery and advise him to wear the patch around  the clock.
E.  Stop drug treatment

###Answer:",A,It is important to maintain a nitrate-free period to prevent the development of tolerance to nitrate therapy. The mononitrate formulation has the longer half life. The nitroglycerin patch should be taken off for 10 to 12 hours daily to allow for nitrate-free interval,Continue once-daily administration of isosorbide  mononitrate but advise the patient to take this  medication in the evening.,Advise continuation of isosorbide mononitrate  twice daily for full 24-hour coverage of anginal  symptoms.,"Switch to isosorbide dinitrate, as this has a longer  duration of action than the mononitrate.",Switch to nitroglycerin patch for consistent drug  delivery and advise him to wear the patch around  the clock.,Stop drug treatment,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient is experiencing nitrate tolerance.  The best option is to continue once-daily administration of isosorbide mononitrate but advise the patient to take this medication in the evening (A). This allows for a 10-12 hour nitrate-free period, which helps to prevent nitrate tolerance. Taking the medication twice daily (B) would lead to further tolerance and decreased efficacy. Isosorbide dinitrate (C) is not a suitable alternative in this scenario. Nitroglycerin patch (D) may not provide a nitrate-free period, which is necessary to prevent tolerance.

###Options:
A.  Angiotensin 3
B.  Angiotensin 2
C.  Hyperkalaemia
D.  Hypernatremia
E.  High levels of ACTH

###Answer:",A,Angiotensin 3 doesn't have a marked direct effect on the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone,Angiotensin 3,Angiotensin 2,Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatremia,High levels of ACTH,D,"D

Rationale: Aldosterone secretion is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin II, which is produced from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), directly stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Hyperkalemia also stimulates aldosterone secretion, as high potassium levels in the blood are detected by the adrenal cortex, which responds by increasing aldosterone production to promote potassium excretion. ACTH, although primarily involved in regulating glucocorticoid production, also has a secondary role in stimulating aldosterone secretion. However, hypernatremia (high sodium levels) does not directly stimulate aldosterone secretion. In fact, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which would decrease sodium levels in the blood.",False,model6

This is usually caused by cervical cord compression.",Ankle jerk reflex,knee jerk reflex,Lumbar puncture,Straight leg raise,Head flexion in a sitting position,D,"D. Straight leg raise

Rationale: The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of sciatica, which is often caused by a herniated intervertebral disk. The straight leg raise test is a physical examination maneuver that can help diagnose sciatica. This test involves lifting the patient's leg while he or she is in a supine position, and it can reproduce the patient's symptoms by putting pressure on the sciatic nerve. The other options are not directly related to diagnosing sciatica or herniated intervertebral disk. Ankle jerk reflex (A) is a test for S1 nerve root function, and knee jerk reflex (B) is a test for L3-L4 nerve root function.

The medication the clinician plans to use may be reversed by protamin sulfate. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?
###Options:
A.  Enhances the action of antithrombin III
B.  Direct inhibition of thrombin (factor II)
C.  Competitive inhibition of plasminogen
D.  Inhibition of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase
E.  indirect inhibition of thrombin (factor II)

###Answer:",A,"Unfractionated heparin is indicated for both the prevention and treatment of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation.

Heparin can also prevent excessive coagulation during cardiac surgery, extracorporeal circulation, or dialysis, including continuous renal replacement therapy.

Unfractionated heparin activates antithrombin III to inhibit Xa indirectly. Enoxaparin inhibits Xa. Both of these medications may be reversed with protamine sulfate.

Various medications are available for prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after joint replacement surgery. They have various modes of action, metabolism, side effects, and level of lab monitoring. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase and may be reversed using fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. Direct Xa inhibitor drugs include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. They all include xa-ban in their names for easy recognition and do not require laboratory monitoring. Their half-life ranges from 8 to 12 hours. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor.

She now tells you thatshe is contemplating pregnancy.What is the most reasonable option for anticoagulation in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Discontinue warfarin and initiate subcutaneous heparin twice daily to goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of at least twice the upper limit of the control, restart warfarin at the beginning of the second trimester, then switch back to subcutaneous heparin at around 36 weeks and continue this until delivery

C.  Discontinue warfarin and initiate weight-based dose-adjusted low molecular weight I heparin until delivery so that there will not be a need to acquire blood work to monitor her anticoagulation
D.  None of the above. Pregnancy is contraindicated

###Answer:",A,"Warfarin is associated with the lowest rate of valve thrombosis in pregnant women.However, because it crosses the placenta, it can cause birth defects and evenspontaneous abortion. The risk is almost exclusively when the fetus is exposedduring the first 12 weeks of gestation. After 12 weeks, warfarin is considered safe,but should be discontinued approximately 2-3 weeks before delivery to avoid havingthe patient fully anticoagulated at the time of delivery. Both unfractionated and lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH) require close monitoring to ensure adequateanticoagulation. If unfractionated heparin is used, the goal aPTT should be at leasttwice control. With LMWH, the anti-Xa level should be between 0.7 and 1.2 U/mL 4hours after administration.","Discontinue warfarin and initiate subcutaneous heparin twice daily to goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of at least twice the upper limit of the control, restart warfarin at the beginning of the second trimester, then switch back to subcutaneous heparin at around 36 weeks and continue this until delivery","Continue warfarin until week 36, keeping her INR between 2.5 and 3.5, then discontinue all anticoagulation and coordinate with her obstetrician to schedule an elective Caesarian section 5 days after the last dose of warfarin",Discontinue warfarin and initiate weight-based dose-adjusted low molecular weight I heparin until delivery so that there will not be a need to acquire blood work to monitor her anticoagulation,None of the above.

Discontinue warfarin and initiate subcutaneous heparin twice daily to goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of at least twice the upper limit of the control, restart warfarin at the beginning of the second trimester, then switch back to subcutaneous heparin at around 36 weeks and continue this until delivery

Rationale: Warfarin is contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects. Therefore, it should be discontinued and replaced with subcutaneous heparin. However, warfarin can be restarted during the second trimester, as the risk of teratogenicity decreases. Then, around 36 weeks, warfarin should be discontinued again and replaced with subcutaneous heparin to minimize the risk of bleeding during delivery. This approach minimizes the risk of bleeding, thrombosis, and teratogenicity. Option B is incorrect because warfarin should not be continued until week 36, and elective Caesarian section should not be scheduled based solely on warfarin use.

###Answer:",B,"Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is produced by the hypothalamus and stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland. GHRH acts on the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, promoting the synthesis and secretion of GH. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) regulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, but they are not directly involved in the regulation of GH secretion.",Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH),Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH),Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),,B,"B

Rationale: Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland. GHRH is released by the hypothalamus in response to various physiological stimuli, such as sleep, exercise, and fasting, and it acts on the pituitary gland to stimulate the release of GH.

###Answer:",B,"Hypercoagulable states are usually inherited or acquired conditions.

This patient most likely has antiphospholipid syndrome associated with antiphospholipid antibodies.

These antiphospholipid antibodies occur in 3 to 5% of the population and may cause arterial or venous thrombosis and fetal loss.

The other listed causes are less likely to cause this constellation of symptoms in this patient.",Uterine infection,Autoantibodies,Heavy smoking,Underlying malignancy,Drinking alcohol,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's history of DVT and recurrent spontaneous abortions suggests a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is a condition characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are associated with recurrent thrombosis and spontaneous abortions. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can cause pregnancy loss.

What investigation will most likely establish a diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Electrocardiogram
B.  Iron studies
C.  Two-dimensional echocardiography
D.  Chest x-ray
E.  full blood count

###Answer:",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is constrictive pericarditis. In developed nations, the leading cause of this condition is idiopathic or post-viral infection, with the incidence being 40 to 60% of total cases

The American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend using echocardiography to diagnose constrictive pericarditis and any other pericardial disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography may show increased pericardial thickness without or without calcification

Two-dimensional echocardiography may also reveal dilatation of the inferior vena cava without inspiratory collapse. A sharp halt in diastolic filling may be seen along with the abrupt transient movement of the intraventricular septum towards the right side, also known as septal bounce

The plain chest x-ray may show pericardial calcification, but it does not prove constriction is present.

Abdominal radiographs would most likely show dilated loops of the bowel. The presence of valvulae conniventes and a greater than 2 cm height difference on the same loop of the bowel but at different heights favor small bowel obstruction.

With strangulation, perforation may occur, which may cause free intraperitoneal air and an exam consistent with peritonitis.

In assessing plain film findings for bowel obstruction, having an upright or decubitus view is typically helpful to visualize air-fluid levels. Asymmetric air-fluid levels are said in some texts to help differentiate obstruction from ileus, though not all texts agree.",A fecalith in the right lower quadrant,Predominantly central dilated loops,Absence of valvulae conniventes,Presence of less than 2 cm height difference on the same loop of the bowel but at different heights,A fecalith in the left lower quadrant,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest small bowel obstruction (SBO). The presence of a mass in the right groin that cannot be reduced suggests an incarcerated inguinal hernia, which is a common cause of SBO. The patient's history of emphysema and home oxygen therapy is incidental. On abdominal radiographs, the diagnosis of SBO is supported by the presence of dilated loops of bowel with an abrupt cutoff, and the ""step ladder"" pattern, which is characterized by a difference of less than 2 cm in height on the same loop of bowel at different heights. This pattern is seen in SBO due to the uniform caliber of the small intestine. Fecaliths are seen in sigmoid volvulus, not SBO. Valvulae conniventes are folds of the mucosa and submucosa that are seen in the small intestine, but their absence is not a diagnostic feature of SBO.",False,model6

Rationale: 
In an African context with limited access to cardiac surgery, medical management with diuretics is the most appropriate initial management for a patient presenting with severe aortic stenosis. This is because aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement may not be readily available or accessible. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is not a recommended treatment for aortic stenosis in adults, as it has not been shown to improve symptoms or survival.

Vancomycin and ceftriaxone can be used for other organisms causing bacterial meningitis, like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitides.",Chloramphenicol,Moxifloxacin,Ciprofloxacin,Ampicillin,cefixime,D,"D

Rationale: The Gram stain of the CSF shows short purple rods that are either single or in short chains, which suggests the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is often resistant to cephalosporins, but sensitive to ampicillin. Therefore, ampicillin should be added to the treatment regimen. The patient is already receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone, which is a good empiric regimen for meningitis. Chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin, and ciprofloxacin are not typically used to treat Listeria meningitis. Cefixime is a cephalosporin and would not be effective against Listeria.",True,model6

Symptoms have been present for 6  months and are progressive. The patient has had two episodes of near impaction, but copious water ingestion and repeated swallows allowed the food bolus to pass. She has never had to present to the ER for disimpaction. She drinks five to six beers per day, loves spicy foods, and smokes a pack of cigarettes daily with a total lifetime history of 30  pack-years. She has had intermittent heartburn symptoms for years and has not sought treatment. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Review of symptoms reveals chronic cough. Physical examination is unremarkable. Upper endoscopy reveals a distal esophageal stricture with inflammatory changes. Esophageal biopsies reveal benign mucosa with chronic inflammation. Gastric biopsies are unremarkable.  Helicobacter pylori testing is negative. What is the most likely etiology of the patients stricture?
###Options:
A.  alcohol ingestion
B.  tobacco use
C.  gastroesophageal reflux

E.  spicy food ingestion

###Answer:",C,"The patient has a peptic stricture, seen in the setting of long-standing untreated gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis. The history of progressive solid food dysphagia without weight loss is typical. Tobacco, alcohol, thiazide diuretics, and spicy foods do not predispose to benign esophageal strictures. The patient has developed a peptic stricture, a serious complication of GERD. The patient needs esophageal dilation (either with mechanical or pneumatic dilators) and maximal acid suppression. PPI therapy is superior to histamine receptor antagonist therapy in terms of healing erosive esophagitis. Patients with long-standing GERD are at increased risk of developing Barrett esophagus, a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. GERD is not a risk factor for esophageal squamous cell cancer, gastric cancer, or duodenal cancer.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including solid food dysphagia without weight loss, progressive symptoms, and near impaction episodes, suggest a mechanical obstruction. The presence of a distal esophageal stricture with inflammatory changes on endoscopy supports this diagnosis. The most likely etiology of the patient's stricture is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is suggested by the patient's history of intermittent heartburn symptoms. The chronic inflammation seen on esophageal biopsies also supports this diagnosis. While the patient's alcohol and tobacco use may contribute to her symptoms, they are not the primary cause of the stricture.

E.  Pain control, laxatives, Sitz baths, and GI referral.

###Answer:",E,"The patient presents with rectal pain on every bowel movement. There is no mention of erythema, fevers, or purulent discharge to suggest an anal fistula. Furthermore, anal fistulas are more likely to occur in those with Crohn's disease.

An anal fissure is the answer of choice as this patient's exam cannot be fully completed due to pain. The presentation is acute, and patients likely report having fears of bowel movements due to the nature of the pain.

The pain of an anal fissure can be intense and burning, most commonly during defecation, and can last for an extended time after. Onset can be abrupt or chronic, and usually, constipation is associated with it unless an underlying pathology exists.

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of anal fissure, which is a tear in the lining of the anus. The symptoms are consistent with an anal fissure, including severe pain during bowel movements, bleeding, and fear of having a bowel movement leading to constipation. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis does not seem to be contributing to his current symptoms. The most appropriate therapy would be to treat the pain with pain control, laxatives to help soften the stool, Sitz baths to help with relaxation of the anal sphincter, and a GI referral to rule out any other conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms. Topical nitroglycerin ointment may be used to help relax the anal sphincter, but it is not the primary therapy.

The risk of stopping the medications is that a thromboticevent will occur, which is more serious than a small postoperative haemorrhage; hencethe risks of stopping medications outweigh the benefits.",Preoperative INR blood test,Ask the patient to stop taking both the aspirin and the dipyridamole for 72 hours before the procedure,Ask the patient to stop taking both the aspirin and the dipyridamole for 7 days before the procedure,Ask the patient to stop taking the dipyridamole for 72 hours before the procedure,Use local haemostatic measures after removing the tooth,E,"E. Use local haemostatic measures after removing the tooth

Rationale: 
The patient is taking low dose aspirin and dipyridamole, which are both antiplatelet medications. Stopping these medications before the procedure can increase the risk of stent thrombosis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is recommended to continue these medications and use local haemostatic measures after removing the tooth to control bleeding. Local haemostatic measures include applying pressure, using haemostatic agents, or suturing the socket.",True,model6

She states that her periods started at 13, and she has had regular cycles until now. Which of the following needs to be considered first when doing a workup for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Hypothyroidism
B.  Hyperthyroidism
C.  Pelvic inflammatory disease
D.  Endometrial hyperplasia
E.  Pregnancy

###Answer:",E,"The initial evaluation of any patient presenting with vaginal bleeding should include an evaluation for pregnancy because one of the first signs of ectopic pregnancy is vaginal bleeding.

A hormonal imbalance, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or cancer may cause Menometrorrhagia.

In a patient with severe bleeding but is hemodynamically stable, initial treatment consists of high-dose estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, high-dose oral progestins, or intravenous tranexamic acid. If these measures are not sufficient, then endometrial ablation should be considered.

Long-term treatment options include intrauterine hormonal devices that consist of levonorgestrel, estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, oral tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, and depot medroxyprogesterone.",Hypothyroidism,Hyperthyroidism,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Endometrial hyperplasia,Pregnancy,E,"E. Pregnancy

Rationale: The first step in evaluating abnormal uterine bleeding is to rule out pregnancy. The patient may have a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or a molar pregnancy that is causing the bleeding. Therefore, a pregnancy test should be performed first to rule out any pregnancy-related complications. After excluding pregnancy, other causes such as hormonal imbalances, endometrial hyperplasia, and pelvic inflammatory disease can be considered.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  An ankle-brachial index less than 0.8
B.  Age
C.  Intermittent claudication
D.  sex
E.  Toe gangrene

###Answer:",B,"This patient is at risk for loss of his limb due to arterial occlusive disease. Indications for surgery include gangrene and resting pain.

Most patients with intermittent claudication can be managed medically. Exercise will increase collateral blood flow, and smoking cessation is mandatory.

The ankle-brachial index is an important, noninvasive evaluation but does not provide enough information to take a patient to surgery.

Before surgery can be done, one needs to know if the patient has a patent vessel in the distal leg. Thus, an angiogram is necessary. In addition, there is a need for a saphenous vein graft.",An ankle-brachial index less than 0.8,Age,Intermittent claudication,sex,Toe gangrene,C,"C

Rationale: 
The patient in this scenario has symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with intermittent claudication, which is a classic indication for reconstructive arterial surgery. The goal of surgery is to improve blood flow to the affected limb and relieve symptoms. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a diagnostic test that helps to confirm the diagnosis of PAD, but an ABI of less than 0.8 is not an indication for surgery in and of itself. Similarly, age, sex, and toe gangrene are not indications for surgery, although they may be relevant to the patient's overall health and prognosis.",False,model6

###Answer:",B,"Correct Answer
B. Cystitis
Explanation
The correct answer is cystitis. Cystitis is an infection of the urinary tract, specifically the bladder. The symptoms described, such as frequent urination, urgency, burning sensation, and lower abdominal pain, are all indicative of cystitis. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form on the ovaries and typically do not cause these urinary symptoms. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause symptoms such as vaginal discharge and pelvic pain but does not typically cause urinary symptoms. PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) is an infection of the reproductive organs and can cause symptoms such as pelvic pain and abnormal vaginal discharge, but may not present with urinary symptoms like frequent urination and burning sensation",Ovarian cyst,Cystitis,PID,Chlamydia,Gonorrhoea,B,"B.  Cystitis

Rationale: The symptoms described are typical of a urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically cystitis, which is an infection of the bladder. The symptoms include fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and burning sensation while urinating. Cystitis is usually caused by bacterial infection, and the symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. While PID, chlamydia, and gonorrhea are all possible causes of pelvic pain and infection, the symptoms described are more consistent with a UTI.

Rationale: Cocaine toxicity can cause agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or lorazepam, are the treatment of choice for cocaine toxicity because they can help calm the patient down, decrease heart rate, decrease blood pressure, and decrease body temperature. They also have anticonvulsant properties, which can help treat seizures that may occur in cocaine toxicity. Gastric lavage is not indicated in this situation because the patient has already absorbed the cocaine. Atropine is not indicated because cocaine toxicity does not involve CNS depression. Phenobarbital may be used as an anticonvulsant, but benzodiazepines are a better choice.

###Options:
A.  Von Willebrand disease
B.  Sickle cell anemia
C.  Hemophilia
D.  Iron deficiency anemia
E.  Thalassemia

###Answer:",C,The correct answer is c) Hemophilia. This condition is characterized by an inability for the blood to clot normally due to the absence or malfunction of certain clotting factors.,Von Willebrand disease,Sickle cell anemia,Hemophilia,Iron deficiency anemia,Thalassemia,C,"C.  Hemophilia

Rationale: Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot, leading to excessive bleeding. It is caused by a deficiency in one of the clotting factors, usually factor VIII or IX. This deficiency impairs the blood's ability to form clots, resulting in prolonged bleeding after an injury or spontaneous bleeding into joints or muscles. Von Willebrand disease is a related disorder that affects platelet function, but it is not the same as hemophilia. Sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and thalassemia are all types of anemia, which are disorders of red blood cells, not clotting factors.",True,model6

The pain is on the lateral shoulder, does not radiate, and is worse with overhead activity. She has pain at night when trying to sleep on her side, and has tried taking over-the-counter ibuprofen intermittently for pain relief. She denies any history of trauma or injury. She states that her normal activities include gardening, yoga, pickleball, and walking. The patient is right-handed. On physical examination, her symptoms are reproduced with both empty and full can test, and there is no external rotation lag sign. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a <50% supraspinatus tear. Which of the following treatments is recommended?
###Options:
A.  Corticosteroid injection
B.  Physical therapy
C.  Surgical repair
D.  Ibuprofen 3 times a day for 1-2 months
E.  Diazepam

###Answer:",B,"With the chronicity of her likely rotator cuff injury/tear, she would fit best as a group 2 patient. This grouping is for patients who may have surgical indications, but physical therapy is of equal benefit in the short term.

It can take from 6-12 weeks to see results from therapy. The best predictor of failure is a patient who does not believe rehabilitation can be effective at improving their pain and function.

Corticosteroids have never been shown to be of benefit in the healing of a rotator cuff tear. There is some literature showing an initial weakening of the tendon in the short term (14 days). These injections can be most effective in short-term pain relief. Caution should be exercised to avoid injecting directly into the tendon.

The natural history of cuff disease is for the tear to progress, but this generally happens when the tear is larger than 50%. The progression of the tear happens slowly, thus allowing time to see if the patient responds to this treatment. Rotator cuff tears are prevalent. About 25% of patients over 60 and 50% of patients over 80 have asymptomatic rotator cuff tears.",Corticosteroid injection,Physical therapy,Surgical repair,Ibuprofen 3 times a day for 1-2 months,Diazepam,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with rotator cuff tendinopathy, which is the most common cause of shoulder pain in adults. The presence of a small tear on MRI does not necessarily indicate the need for surgical repair, especially in an older adult. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention, and the tear is not large enough to be causing significant mechanical symptoms. Corticosteroid injection may provide temporary pain relief, but it does not address the underlying tendinopathy. Ibuprofen 3 times a day for 1-2 months may also provide temporary pain relief, but it does not address the underlying tendinopathy. Diazepam is not indicated for shoulder pain. Physical therapy is the recommended treatment because it can help to improve shoulder strength, flexibility, and range of motion, and can also help to improve scapular stabilization and posture, which can reduce the stress on the rotator cuff tendons.",True,model6

Rationale: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin secretion. It is a major public health concern in Africa, where its prevalence is increasing due to factors such as urbanization, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets. In T2DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas is a gradual process, leading to hyperglycemia.

###Options:
A.  Below-normal arterial PO2
B.  Below-normal arterial PCO2
C.  Greater than normal arterial blood pressure
D.  Lower than normal pulmonary arterial pressure
E.  None of the above

",Below-normal arterial PO2,Below-normal arterial PCO2,Greater than normal arterial blood pressure,Lower than normal pulmonary arterial pressure,None of the above,A,"A

Rationale: A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) allows oxygenated blood from the aorta to flow back into the pulmonary artery, bypassing the lungs. As a result, the blood that reaches the tissues is not fully oxygenated, leading to a lower than normal arterial PO2. The other options are incorrect because a PDA does not directly affect arterial PCO2, blood pressure, or pulmonary arterial pressure. However, it's worth noting that a large PDA can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, which can cause pulmonary hypertension and eventually heart failure.",True,model6

The mnemonic DUMBBELS (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bronchorrhea/bradycardia, emesis, lacrimation, salivation) can be used to remember the signs and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity. An anticholinergic antidote, atropine, controls these muscarinic symptoms, whereas the antidote pralidoxime treats the nicotinic symptoms like fasciculations (involuntary muscle quivering or twitching). N-acetylcysteine is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose and acts as a sulfhydryl donor.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including diarrhea, tearing, nausea and vomiting, sweating, anxiety, and fasciculations, are consistent with cholinergic toxicity. The pinpoint pupils are also a hallmark of this syndrome. The most likely cause is organophosphate poisoning, which is commonly seen in agricultural workers. Atropine is the antidote of choice for organophosphate poisoning, and it should be administered first to counteract the muscarinic effects of the toxin.

Rationale: Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a complication of pregnancy where the amniotic sac ruptures before the onset of labor. In cases of PROM, conservative management involves monitoring the mother and fetus closely to prevent complications like infection and fetal distress. Frequent vaginal examination is not recommended in conservative management of PROM as it can increase the risk of infection. Instead, digital examination should be minimized or avoided to reduce the risk of infection. Serial complete blood count to diagnose rising of WBC (option A) can help in monitoring for signs of infection.

###Options:
A.  Foreign body
B.  Nasal polyps
C.  Frontal sinusitis
D.  Deviated septum
E.  Choanal atresia

###Answer:",A,"Young children often insert various small objects into their noses, including food or small toys. Initially, this may only cause local irritation. However, as the obstruction persists, symptoms may escalate, manifesting as increased pain and the appearance of a purulent, foul-smelling, bloody discharge. When unilateral nasal discharge is present alongside obstruction, it suggests the possibility of a nasal foreign body and warrants examination. While polyps could potentially cause unilateral nasal obstruction, they are uncommon in children of 18 months and might indicate a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, though not impossible, is rare in black children. Frontal sinusitis typically doesn't result in unilateral symptoms, and sinusitis is uncommon in an 18-month-old child due to incomplete sinus development at that age. Similarly, a deviated septum is not typically found in young children. Choanal atresia typically presents in the newborn period, characterized by episodes of respiratory distress at rest that improve with crying.",Foreign body,Nasal polyps,Frontal sinusitis,Deviated septum,Choanal atresia,A,"A

Rationale: The presence of unilateral nasal obstruction and foul-smelling discharge in an otherwise healthy 18-month-old child is highly suggestive of a nasal foreign body. This is especially common in children of this age group who are curious and often insert small objects into their nostrils. The foul-smelling discharge is likely due to the presence of a retained foreign body, which can cause a secondary infection. Nasal polyps (option B) are rare in children and usually occur in association with cystic fibrosis or allergic rhinitis. Frontal sinusitis (option C) is unlikely in an 18-month-old child, as the frontal sinuses do not develop until around 6 years of age. Deviated septum (option D) may cause nasal obstruction, but it is unlikely to cause a foul-smelling discharge.

His vaccinations are up to date. At the age of 18 months, he received the meningococcal vaccine due to a meningococcus outbreak. Within hours of the vaccine, the boy developed a fever and generalized seizure that lasted about 2 minutes. He was taken to the emergency department for observation and subsequently discharged. He has had no further seizures or other medical problems and takes no medications. Family history is positive for an uncle with febrile seizures during childhood. Vital signs and physical examination are normal. The child is due for a booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient's management?
###Options:
A.  Discontinue immunizations
B.  Administer the booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine
C.  Perform electroencephalogram
D.  Perform electroencephalogram
E.  None

###Answer:",B,"Fever has been reported as an adverse effect of meningococcal vaccine administration but at a low frequency.

A history of post-vaccination fever is not a contraindication for meningococcal vaccine re-administration.

In a case of meningococcal outbreaks, a single dose of meningococcal vaccine is usually recommended in most adults and children (age =24 months).

The meningococcal vaccine is contraindicated in people known to have a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine.",Discontinue immunizations,Administer the booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine,Perform electroencephalogram,Perform electroencephalogram,,B,"B

Rationale: This patient had a febrile seizure following the meningococcal vaccine at 18 months of age. The risk of recurrence of febrile seizures is higher in patients with a family history of febrile seizures, which is present in this case. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends continuing vaccinations, including the meningococcal vaccine, in patients with a history of febrile seizures. The patient should receive the booster dose of the meningococcal vaccine as scheduled.

E.  none of the above

###Answer:",C,"A history of a calcified or porcelain gallbladder is a strong indication for cholecystectomy. A calcified or porcelain gallbladder is a rare condition in which the wall of the gallbladder becomes calcified, increasing the risk of gallbladder cancer. Therefore, it is recommended to remove the gallbladder in these cases to prevent any potential complications.",A young patient with silent stones,A patient with incidental finding of a single stone >15 mm,A history of a calcified or porcelain gallbladder,"A patient who presented previously with 2 episodes of RUQ pain not interfering with activity, but has not recurred",none of the above,C,"C

Rationale: Cholecystectomy is generally recommended for patients with a calcified or porcelain gallbladder due to the increased risk of gallbladder cancer. Asymptomatic patients with silent stones do not require cholecystectomy unless they have a specific condition that increases their risk of complications, such as a calcified gallbladder, sickle cell disease, or a family history of gallbladder cancer. Patients with a single stone >15 mm may be at higher risk for complications, but cholecystectomy is not necessarily recommended unless they are symptomatic.

She was born 6 hours ago at 37 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy to a 35- year-old woman who had good prenatal care. On physical examination, her skin is pink with no rashes or lesions. Her eyes appear regularly shaped and spaced, and she has a red reflex present in both eyes. Her lips and nose are normal, and her palate has a high arch. She has a webbed neck that is flexible. Her chest is shield shaped with widely spaced nipples. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her breathing is unlabored with a respiratory rate of 50/min. Her femoral pulses are delayed compared to her radial pulses. She is able to move all extremities equally but has edematous hands and feet. She is alert and has normal Moro and rooting reflexes. Which of the following cardiac examination findings is most likely?
###Options:
A.  Continuous machinery murmur at the left upper sternal border
B.  Harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
C.  Single loud S2
D.  Systolic murmur loudest below the left scapula
E.  Widely split fixed S2 and systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is D. This female infant most likely has Turners syndrome, with the high-arched palate, webbed neck, widely spaced nipples, and edematous hands and feet. Turners syndrome, or gonadal dysgenesis, is due to the absence of part or all of an X chromosome. It is the most common abnormality of the X chromosome, with an incidence of 1:2000 to 5000 liveborn girls. In the neonate, other possible findings include dysplastic nails and a short fourth metacarpal. Twenty percent or more of patients with Turners syndrome also have a congenital heart defect. Bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta are the most common cardiovascular malformations in Turners syndrome patients. This patients delayed femoral pulses suggest coarctation of the aorta, which is associated with a systolic murmur loudest below the left scapula. If tested, those with coarctation of the aorta will also have decreased blood pressures in the lower extremities versus the upper. If the ductus arteriosus is patent, patients may be asymptomatic. If it is closed, neonates may present with heart failure and be pale, irritable, diaphoretic, and dyspneic.",Continuous machinery murmur at the left upper sternal border,Harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border,Single loud S2,Systolic murmur loudest below the left scapula,Widely split fixed S2 and systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border,C,"C.  Single loud S2

Rationale: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with Turner syndrome. The cardiac examination finding most likely in this patient is a single loud S2, which is consistent with coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is a common cardiac anomaly in Turner syndrome, occurring in approximately 30% of patients.

###Options:
A.  Nephrotic syndrome
B.  Child abuse
C.  Water intoxication
D.  Diabetes mellitus
E.  Diabetes insipidus

###Answer:",E,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a hereditary disorder characterized by the kidneys' inability to respond to antidiuretic hormone, resulting in hypotonic urine production in large volumes. Most North American patients affected by this condition are descendants of Ulster Scots who arrived in Nova Scotia in 1761 on the ship Hopewell. The disorder primarily affects males through X-linked recessive inheritance, involving inactivating mutations of the vasopressin V2 receptor. However, autosomal dominant and recessive forms also exist. The disorder is thought to arise from primary unresponsiveness of the distal tubule and collecting duct to vasopressin. While present at birth, the diagnosis is often delayed until several months later when symptoms such as excessive thirst, frequent voiding of large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, and failure to thrive become evident. Therapy for this incurable disease primarily involves maintaining adequate fluid intake, dietary management, and the use of saluretic medications to promote sodium excretion in the kidneys.Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can result from various medications (such as lithium, methicillin, rifampin, and amphotericin) and may also be associated with conditions like hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, polycystic kidney disease, Sjögren syndrome, and sickle cell disease.Water intoxication would not manifest with episodes of dehydration. Diabetes mellitus rarely presents with a protracted course in such a young child and is typically more acute, often accompanied by vomiting. Child abuse is unlikely, especially with a noted family history. Nephrotic syndrome would typically present with additional signs such as edema and proteinuria.",Nephrotic syndrome,Child abuse,Water intoxication,Diabetes mellitus,Diabetes insipidus,E,"E. Diabetes insipidus

Rationale: Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare condition characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to polyuria (excessive urine production) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). The symptoms of DI are consistent with the child's presentation, including failure to thrive, frequent large voids of dilute urine, and recurrent dehydration. The family history of similar symptoms also supports this diagnosis, as DI can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Nephrotic syndrome (A) would typically present with edema and proteinuria, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Child abuse (B) is unlikely, given the specific symptoms and family history. Water intoxication (C) can cause hyponatremia and seizures, but it is not a chronic condition that would explain the child's failure to thrive. Diabetes mellitus (D) would typically present with hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketonuria, which are not mentioned in this scenario.",True,model6

The patient reports heavy alcohol consumption and that he often ""passes out"" following consumption. He reports numbness in the left leg on the dorsum and sides of the foot. He is unable to pick his foot from the ground. Motor examination revealed that the patient was unable to dorsiflex his left foot. The sensory exam revealed absent sensation over the entire dorsum, including the first webspace. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these deficits?
###Options:
A.  Common peroneal nerve compression
B.  Sciatic nerve compression
C.  Tibial nerve compression
D.  Superficial peroneal nerve compression
E.  saphenous nerve damage

###Answer:",A,"The common Fibular(peroneal) nerve divides into superficial and deep divisions at the fibular head. An intoxicated state for a prolonged time could have led to compression at this location. This will result in symptoms involving weakness in the muscles supplied by the deep division, i.e., the dorsiflexors, and the superficial division, i.e., the evertors. The sensory loss will involve both the dorsum and the first web space supplied by the superficial and deep divisions, respectively.

The deep fibular division supplies the anterior compartment of the lower extremity. These are the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus tertius  these muscles aid in performing dorsiflexion, which brings the foot up during heel strike.

The deep fibular nerve supplies sensation to the dorsum, specifically at the first webspace.

The superficial fibular nerve supplies the peroneus longus and brevis, the main evertors of the foot. The superficial branch supplies sensation to the dorsum of the foot and lateral calf.",Common peroneal nerve compression,Sciatic nerve compression,Tibial nerve compression,Superficial peroneal nerve compression,saphenous nerve damage,A,"A

Rationale: The symptoms described, including numbness on the dorsum and sides of the foot and inability to dorsiflex the foot, are consistent with damage to the common peroneal nerve. This nerve is responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot and sensation on the dorsum of the foot. The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve and is susceptible to compression or injury, particularly in individuals who are malnourished or have a history of alcoholism. Compression of this nerve can result in foot drop, which is the inability to lift the foot while walking, leading to a characteristic ""slapping"" gait.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"The presence of a uric acid calculus suggests a disorder of purine metabolism, specifically an excess of uric acid production or impaired uric acid excretion. Uric acid is a byproduct of purine metabolism, and abnormalities in its metabolism can lead to the formation of uric acid stones.Given that the patient presents with a uric acid calculus and no other history suggestive of disorders associated with options (A), (B), (C), or (E), the most likely impairment in this patient is purine metabolism.Therefore, the correct answer is:(D) Purine metabolism",Bile salt metabolism,Cholesterol metabolism,Cytochrome P450 activity,Purine metabolism,Urea cycle,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a uric acid calculus suggest that the patient has a problem with purine metabolism, leading to an overproduction of uric acid. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including genetic disorders, certain medications, and certain cancers.

B.  A large quantity of estrogen-like compounds
C.  Follicle-stimulating hormone
D.  Testosterone
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"In order for a male embryo to develop male genitalia, testosterone must be present in the embryo. Normally, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) secreted by the trophoblast cells stimulates testosterone secretion from the testes. Giving an antibody that blocks HCG would prevent testosterone secretion, resulting in the development of female genitalia in a male fetus. ",An antibody that blocked the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin in the embryo and fetus,A large quantity of estrogen-like compounds,Follicle-stimulating hormone,Testosterone,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: The correct answer is B. A large quantity of estrogen-like compounds. The description of the pups having XY chromosomes but female genital organs suggests that the substance given to the pregnant rats blocked the masculinizing effects of androgens on the developing genitalia. This is consistent with the effect of estrogen-like compounds, which can feminize the genitalia of a genetically male fetus. Option A is incorrect because blocking the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin would not specifically affect genital development.

B.  With her progressive liver dysfunction, increased total serum bilirubin is anticipated
C.  Administration of N-acetylcysteine is first-line therapy
D.  Seizures are uncommon with this condition.
E.  Death is usually associated with increased intracranial pressures and herniation

###Answer:",E,"Reye syndrome is a mitochondrial hepatopathy acquired through the interaction of an influenza or varicella infection and aspirin use. Although its prevalence has declined over recent decades, its mortality rate remains over 40%. Elevated liver enzymes and ammonia levels are common, but total bilirubin typically remains normal. Initial symptoms usually manifest near the end of a viral infection and include sleepiness, vomiting, and abnormal liver function. As the syndrome progresses, patients may experience seizures, coma, hyperventilation, and decorticate posturing. In severe cases, respiratory arrest, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and fixed and dilated pupils may occur. Death often results from cerebral edema and subsequent herniation. While aspirin is no longer commonly used in children for fever or pain relief, its increased use in adults with heart disease necessitates specific counseling for parents to avoid aspirin use in children with influenza or varicella. Furthermore, both of these infections are preventable through appropriate immunization. N-acetylcysteine offers hepatocyte protection in cases of acetaminophen overdose.","With proper supportive care, the overall mortality rate is low","With her progressive liver dysfunction, increased total serum bilirubin is anticipated",Administration of N-acetylcysteine is first-line therapy,Seizures are uncommon with this condition.,Death is usually associated with increased intracranial pressures and herniation,E,"E

Rationale: The scenario described is likely a case of Reye syndrome, a rare but serious condition that occurs primarily in children recovering from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox.

###Answer:",A,"Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is at greatest risk for (A) Adenocarcinoma of the colon. The presence of intermittent diarrhea with blood and mucus, along with erythematous, inflamed mucosa on endoscopy, suggests inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis in this case. Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, especially if the disease involves a significant portion of the colon. Additionally, the presence of uveitis and tender nodules on the lower extremities suggests an association with extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, further increasing the risk.",Adenocarcinoma of the colon,Cholelithiasis,Nephrolithiasis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Spontaneous bacterial perit,A,"A

Rationale: The patient has ulcerative colitis (UC) based on the endoscopy results, which showed erythematous, inflamed mucosa of the rectum and sigmoid colon. He is at greatest risk for developing adenocarcinoma of the colon. The risk of colon cancer is increased in patients with UC, especially those with pancolitis (involvement of the entire colon) and those with longer duration of disease.

Rationale: The primary reason for administering the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy is to provide passive immunity to the newborn against pertussis. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for pregnant women between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation to protect their newborns from pertussis (whooping cough) in the first few months of life. This is because pertussis can be severe and even life-threatening in young infants, and they do not receive their first dose of pertussis vaccine until 2 months of age.

Rationale: Stool analysis is useful in detecting hookworm infestation (A. Necator americanus and C. Ankylostoma duodenale) which can cause anaemia in pregnancy. However, stool analysis is not a reliable method for detecting Ascaris lumbricoides (B) as they are not typically shed in the stool. Ascaris lumbricoides is usually diagnosed by finding the worms in the stool or vomit, or by radiological studies. Stool analysis can detect occult blood (D) which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding due to various causes including hookworm infestation.",True,model6

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Osteomyelitis
B.  Osteosarcoma
C.  Ewing sarcoma
D.  Giant cell tumor
E.  Chondroblastoma

###Answer:",B,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone occurring in children and adolescents. Classically, osteosarcoma presents with abrupt onset of pain and swelling, often at the metaphyses around the knee. On radiographic imaging, osteosarcomas typically present as osteolytic or mixed osteolytic-osteoblastic lesions with a sunburst pattern and Codman's triangle.",Osteomyelitis,Osteosarcoma,Ewing sarcoma,Giant cell tumor,Chondroblastoma,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's age, symptoms, and radiographic findings are consistent with osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically affects adolescents and young adults, with the peak incidence between 15 and 25 years of age. It commonly presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling in the affected limb, and radiographic imaging typically shows an osteolytic lesion in the metaphysis of a long bone, such as the distal femur. While osteomyelitis (A) can also cause bone destruction and swelling, it is typically accompanied by fever and systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Ewing sarcoma (C) is another type of malignant bone tumor, but it typically affects younger children and often presents with systemic symptoms. Giant cell tumor (D) is a benign bone tumor that typically affects older adults and is less likely to present with acute symptoms. Chondroblastoma (E) is a rare benign bone tumor that typically affects the epiphysis of a long bone and is less likely to present with acute symptoms.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of severe back pain, x-rays showing diffusely decreased bone mass, and low calcium levels are all consistent with osteomalacia, a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to a deficiency of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is common in elderly individuals, especially those who are institutionalized and have limited sun exposure, which is necessary for vitamin D production. In contrast, osteoporosis (option B) is characterized by brittle bones, but not typically hypocalcemia. Multiple myeloma (option A) may cause bone pain and lytic lesions, but not diffuse decreased bone mass. Chronic renal failure (option C) may cause hypocalcemia, but would also be associated with elevated phosphate levels and other electrolyte abnormalities. Primary hyperthyroidism (option E) would not typically cause hypocalcemia.",True,model6

A preterm infant is delivered vaginally with a good cry. Due to prematurity, the neonate is admitted to the neonatal ICU for monitoring. On the first hospital day, the neonate passes 2 bowel movements. On the second hospital day, the child is irritable and refuses to feed. Vital signs are normal. On physical examination, the infant has a soft, non-distended abdomen. She has a yellowing of her eyes and skin. Laboratory test results reveal a total bilirubin of 10 mg/dL with a conjugated bilirubin level of 7 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Crigler-Najjar syndrome
B.  Sepsis
C.  Physiologic jaundice
D.  Breast milk jaundice
E.  brestfeeding jaundice

###Answer:",B,"Prematurity is a strong risk factor for neonatal sepsis. The immune system is not fully developed in premature neonates and cannot execute a complete inflammatory response.

The clinical presentation may involve only non-specific symptoms like irritability or refusal to feed. The neonate may not present with fever but instead, have hypothermia.

Neonatal sepsis may lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to cholestasis. In some patients, jaundice may be the only initial presentation.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome, physiologic jaundice, and breast milk jaundice are all characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, breast milk jaundice typically presents 1 to 2 weeks after birth.

Rationale: 
The neonate in this scenario has a conjugated bilirubin level of 7 mg/dL, which is elevated. Physiologic jaundice and breastfeeding jaundice typically have unconjugated bilirubin elevations. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme glucuronyl transferase, which is necessary for bilirubin conjugation.

He is diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and is scheduled to receive radiotherapy. After his session of radiotherapy, he develops severe vomiting which is not responding to domperidone. Which of the following should have been administered to this patient to prevent this complication?
###Options:
A.  Ondansetron
B.  Cyclizine
C.  Metoclopramide
D.  Dimenhydrinate
E.  Promethazine

###Answer:",A,"Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonist used for its antiemetic properties.

When administered orally, ondansetron tablets should be taken 1 to 2 hours before radiotherapy.

Common uses of ondansetron include the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and radiation-induced nausea and vomiting and the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

Standard oral dosing is 8 mg every 12 hours. Four milligrams IV is a common prophylactic dose for postoperative nausea and vomiting.",Ondansetron,Cyclizine,Metoclopramide,Dimenhydrinate,Promethazine,A,"A

Rationale: Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) is a common complication of radiation therapy, particularly in patients receiving radiation to the upper body, such as the neck, chest, or abdomen. The risk of RINV is higher in younger patients, such as the 17-year-old male in this scenario. Ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is a highly effective antiemetic medication that is commonly used to prevent and treat RINV. It is more effective than other antiemetic medications, such as metoclopramide, cyclizine, and dimenhydrinate, which are typically used for other types of nausea and vomiting. Promethazine is an antihistamine with antiemetic properties, but it is not as effective as ondansetron for RINV. Therefore, ondansetron should have been administered to this patient to prevent radiation-induced vomiting.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Insulin
B.  Antibiotics
C.  ACE inhibitors
D.  Antidepressants
E.  Antihistamines

###Answer:",C,ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) help lower blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart.,Insulin,Antibiotics,ACE inhibitors,Antidepressants,Antihistamines,C,"C.  ACE inhibitors

Rationale: ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are a type of medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). They work by relaxing blood vessels, which helps to lower blood pressure. ACE inhibitors do this by blocking the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, a chemical that constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. This relaxation of blood vessels reduces the pressure on the heart and improves blood flow to the body. Examples of ACE inhibitors include enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril.",True,model6

The patient has approximately six blood stained or blood streaked stools per day, associated with relatively little, if any, pain. He has not had any weight loss, and he has been able to attend classes without interruption. He denies any fecal incontinence. He has no prior medical history. Review of systems is remarkable only for occasional fevers and the fact that the patient quit smoking approximately 8 months ago.  A colonoscopy is performed and reveals a granular, friable colonic mucosal surface with loss of normal vascular pattern from the anal verge to the hepatic flexure of the colon. Biopsies reveal prominent neutrophils in the epithelium and cryptitis with focal crypt abscesses, and no dysplasia. The patient is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?
###Options:
A.  colectomy
B.  Oral prednisone
C.  Oral metronidazole
D.  cortisone enemas
E.  intravenous cyclosporine

###Answer:",B,"Oral corticosteroids are a mainstay of firstline treatment for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Starting doses of 40 mg PO daily of prednisone, with a slow taper, are often effective in  reducing colonic inflammation, although some patients are unable to wean steroids or maintain remission once achieved. The patient does not have dysplasia in any biopsy specimens, nor does he have signs of systemic toxicity, so a colectomy would be premature. Oral metronidazole is ineffective in ulcerative colitis. Cortisone enemas would be helpful if the patient had isolated left-sided disease, but it is doubtful that enema therapy would reach his hepatic flexure. Intravenous cyclosporine would be used in severe colitis as a last measure before colectomy but this patient is not yet sick enough to warrant such therapy. PSC occurs in approximately 3% of patients with ulcerative colitis and is its major liver complication. It is a chronic inflammatory condition of the biliary tree. It can typically  manifest with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, and results in diffuse stricturing and pruning of the biliary tree. Wilson disease, hereditary hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are not associated with ulcerative colitis and are not cholestatic liver diseases. Primary biliary cirrhosis could account for these laboratory findings, but is rare in both males and patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients with PSC are at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma but not the other liver tumors mentioned. Patients with celiac sprue are at increased risk for small bowel cancers (adenocarcinoma, lymphoma). Patients with FAP are  at increased risk to develop desmoid tumors.",colectomy,Oral prednisone,Oral metronidazole,cortisone enemas,intravenous cyclosporine,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient has a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis based on the colonoscopy and biopsy results. The best initial treatment for this patient is oral prednisone. The patient has a moderate to severe colitis based on the frequency of bloody stools and the presence of fever. Oral prednisone is effective in inducing remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Cortisone enemas (option D) may be effective for patients with mild proctitis or distal colitis, but they are not sufficient for a patient with pancolitis. Colectomy (option A) is a surgical option that is usually reserved for patients who are refractory to medical therapy or who have complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation. Metronidazole (option C) is an antibiotic that is often used to treat Crohn's disease, but it is not a first-line agent for ulcerative colitis. Intravenous cyclosporine (option E) is a medication that is sometimes used to treat patients with severe ulcerative colitis who are refractory to intravenous steroids, but it is not a first-line agent.",True,model6

D.  Paracervical or ureteral nodes
E.  Para-aortic nodes

###Answer:",D,"The primary pathways through which cervical cancer spreads are via the vaginal mucosa, myometrium, paracervical lymphatics, and direct extension into the parametrium. The likelihood of lymph node involvement increases with the advancement of the disease stage. The key lymph node groups affected by cervical cancer spread are the paracervical, parametrial, obturator, hypogastric, external iliac, and sacral nodes, typically in that sequence. Less frequently, involvement may occur in the common iliac, inguinal, and para-aortic nodes. In stage I, roughly 15% of cases show positive pelvic node involvement and 6% show para-aortic node involvement. In stage II, these rates increase to 28% and 16% respectively.

Calcitonin is produced by the parafollicular (C) cells of the thyroid gland and acts to lower blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity, which reduces bone resorption, and promoting calcium deposition into bone matrix. It plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis alongside parathyroid hormone (PTH), which acts to raise blood calcium levels by stimulating bone resorption and calcium release from bones.ition.",Parathyroid hormone (PTH),Calcitonin,Vitamin D,Growth hormone,Estrogen,B,"B

Rationale: Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that plays a crucial role in promoting bone formation and calcium deposition. It helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood by inhibiting bone resorption and promoting bone formation. This is in contrast to parathyroid hormone (PTH), which promotes bone resorption and increases calcium levels in the blood.

E.  Presence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk

###Answer:",D,"The inability to perform a tandem walk may be seen in ataxia due to sensory or cerebellar deficits. Additional cerebellar testing such as dysmetria, diadochokinesia, and testing for Romberg sign helps differentiate a sensory lesion from a cerebellar lesion.

The presence of Romberg's sign indicates a lesion in the sensory or vestibular pathways, as the patient is able to correct posture using vision. The inability to maintain posture, even with the use of vision, suggests a more central etiology, such as a cerebellar lesion.

Unilateral dysmetria is seen in lesions of the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere and can help differentiate cerebellar ataxia from sensory ataxia.

In this case, other supportive features for sensory neuronopathy or neuropathy would be loss of vibration and proprioception and absent deep tendon reflexes at the knee and ankle.","Unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk","Unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, absence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body regardless if eyes are open or closed), and inability to perform a tandem walk","Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, absence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body regardless if eyes are open or closed), and inability to perform a tandem walk","Absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk","Presence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open), and inability to perform a tandem walk",D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a sensory ataxia, which can be caused by a peripheral neuropathy or a cerebellar lesion. The Romberg sign is a test of proprioception and is positive in patients with sensory ataxia due to a peripheral neuropathy. In this case, the presence of Romberg sign (swaying of the body while eyes are closed but not when eyes are open) supports a peripheral neuropathy over a cerebellar lesion. The absence of unilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing also supports a peripheral neuropathy, as cerebellar lesions typically cause unilateral dysmetria.

The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic system are short compared to those of the sympathetic division. The adrenal medulla is under the control of the sympathetic system",The parasympathetic system uses norepinephrine  as a neurotransmitter,"The parasympathetic system often discharges as a  single, functional system.","The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.",The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic  division are long compared to those of the  sympathetic nervous system,The parasympathetic system controls the secretion  of the adrenal medulla,C,"C.  The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.

Rationale: The parasympathetic nervous system is involved in various functions that promote relaxation and restoration. It is responsible for accommodation of near vision (constriction of the pupil and ciliary muscle relaxation), movement of food (peristalsis), and urination (contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter). Option A is incorrect because norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, not the parasympathetic nervous system. Option B is incorrect because the parasympathetic system, like the sympathetic nervous system, often discharges in a localized manner to specific organs or tissues, rather than as a single, functional system. Option D is incorrect because the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division are typically shorter compared to those of the sympathetic nervous system. Option E is incorrect because the parasympathetic system does not control the secretion of the adrenal medulla, which is actually controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"Nabothian cysts occur when a cleft of columnar endocervical cells becomes walled off by epidermidization, entrapping mucous secretions. They are common and benign and are usually recognized visually. Rarely, it may be necessary to biopsy them for identification. This cyst is found on the surface of the cervix, in contrast to the histologically similar Gartners duct cyst (Wolffian duct remnant) found deep within the stroma of the cervix. CIN is not cystic.

Rationale: Nabothian cysts are benign cervical lesions that occur in multiparous women. They are usually asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during routine examination. They are thought to arise from the obstruction of cervical glands by squamous epithelium, leading to the accumulation of mucus. The mucus can be expressed from the cyst, and histologic examination shows a lining of flattened columnar or cuboidal-type cells. Nabothian cysts are not premalignant and do not require treatment unless they become symptomatic.",True,model6

He attributes the weight gain to inability to exercise because of his back pain,and he is now considering applying for disability benefits. He was evaluated by a back pain specialist 3 months ago andunderwent an MRI of the lumbar spine at that time; however, he says he did not understand the specialist's explanationregarding the MRI results and requests further explanation. Medical history also is remarkable for hyperlipidemia,seasonal allergies, and opioid use disorder; he has not used opioids of any kind since he stopped prescription oxycodoneuse 5 years ago. Routine medications are atorvastatin, diclofenac, and loratadine. He develops skin flushing when takingniacin, but he has no known drug allergies. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He previouslydrank two beers daily, but he has not consumed any alcoholic beverages or used any recreational drugs for the past 5years.

It's essential to address smoking cessation as part of the overall management plan to mitigate further progression of low back pain and associated complications.In this patient's case, both options (B) Cigarette smoking and (E) Opioid use could potentially contribute to the MRI findings of chronic low back pain. However, given the significant adverse effects of both factors on spinal health, it's crucial to address both smoking cessation and the history of opioid use in the management plan. The correct answer is B.",Alcohol consumption,Cigarette smoking,Diclofenac use,Loratadine use,Opioid use,B,"B. Cigarette smoking

Rationale: The patient's MRI of the lumbar spine shows diffuse fatty replacement of the vertebral bodies, which is a characteristic finding of osteoporosis. The patient's history of cigarette smoking for 25 years is a strong risk factor for osteoporosis. Cigarette smoking has been consistently shown to increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. The patient's history of chronic back pain and decreased range of motion on lumbar extension and flexion are also consistent with osteoporosis. While the patient's history of opioid use disorder and diclofenac use may contribute to his back pain, they are not directly related to the development of osteoporosis. The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and use of atorvastatin may affect his cardiovascular risk, but they are not related to osteoporosis.

###Options:
A.  Estrogen
B.  Luteinizing hormone
C.  Oxytocin
D.  Human chorionic gonadotropin

Rationale: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the trophoblast cells of the placenta during pregnancy. It is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, a layer of cells that forms the outer layer of the blastocyst. hCG is produced in large quantities during the first trimester of pregnancy and plays a critical role in maintaining the corpus luteum, which in turn produces progesterone to support embryonic development. The levels of hCG in the blood and urine are often used as a diagnostic test for pregnancy.",True,model6

During the 9th month of gestation the uterine muscle becomes progressively more excitable. What factors contribute to the increase in excitability?
###Options:
A.  Placental estrogen synthesis rises to high rates
B.  Progesterone synthesis by the placenta decreases
C.  Uterine blood flow reaches its highest rate
D.  Prostaglandin E2 synthesis by the placenta decreases
E.  Activity of the fetus falls to low levels

###Answer:",B,"Very high plasma concentration of progesterone maintains the uterine muscle in a quiescent state during pregnancy. In the final month of gestation the concentration of progesterone begins to decline, increasing the excitability of the muscle.",Placental estrogen synthesis rises to high rates,Progesterone synthesis by the placenta decreases,Uterine blood flow reaches its highest rate,Prostaglandin E2 synthesis by the placenta decreases,Activity of the fetus falls to low levels,B,"B

Rationale: 
The correct answer is B. Progesterone synthesis by the placenta decreases. During pregnancy, progesterone levels are high and it has a calming effect on the uterine smooth muscle, keeping it quiescent. As the pregnancy progresses and approaches term, progesterone levels decrease, which allows the uterine smooth muscle to become more excitable and responsive to oxytocin and other stimuli, leading to contractions and ultimately labor.",True,model6

He cleaned the wound at home but did not seek medical attention. He now has a fever, and tingling in the lower extremities. While in the emergency department, he had a sudden contraction of the extensor muscles of the neck and trunk, producing a severe backward arching. What is the most probable diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Tetanus
B.  Malaria
C.  Meningitis
D.  Hysteria
E.  spondylitis

###Answer:",A,"Typical opisthotonus, risus sardonicus, and trismus are found in tetanus.

Opisthotonus is a postural abnormality with the arching of the back and extension of extremities. It occurs due to spastic, sustained dystonic contraction of spinal muscles leading to dorsal extension movement of the spine.

Tetanus can be prevented with adequate prophylaxis. If a patient is at risk and the prophylaxis status is unknown, a tetanus booster and tetanus immunoglobulin should be administered.

Cerebral malaria can cause opisthotonus, but there is no exposure. Meningitis, encephalitis, and neurosyphilis can present with opisthotonus.",Tetanus,Malaria,Meningitis,Hysteria,spondylitis,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including the nail puncture wound, fever, and muscle contractions, are consistent with tetanus. The sudden contraction of the extensor muscles of the neck and trunk, producing a severe backward arching, is a characteristic feature of tetanus, known as opisthotonus. Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which can enter the body through open wounds, and can cause muscle stiffness and spasms.

###Options:
A.  inhibiting ovulation by suppression of serum FSH
B.  inducing endometrial atrophy
C.  increasing cervical mucous hostility
D.  inducing endometritis

Rationale: The primary mechanism of action of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) is to inhibit ovulation by suppressing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. This suppression of FSH prevents the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, thereby preventing ovulation. Additionally, COCs also thicken cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to penetrate, and alter the uterine lining, making it less receptive to implantation of a fertilized egg.",True,model6

Common symptoms include fatigue, nonproductive cough, and progressive dyspnea. Pulmonary function testing typically demonstrates a restrictive pattern, and chest radiography or CT usually reveals bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular opacities primarily in the upper and middle lung zones, although lower zone predominance, as in this patient, can occur. The presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy confirms the diagnosis.",Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Sarcoidosis,Langerhans cell histiocytosis,Pulmonary embolism,Silicosis,B,"B. Sarcoidosis

Rationale: The symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and nonproductive cough, along with the radiographic findings of reticulonodular opacities predominantly in the lower lobes, are consistent with a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. The presence of noncaseating granulomas on transbronchial biopsy further supports this diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by noncaseating granulomas, which commonly affect the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin. The symptoms and radiographic findings described are typical of stage II sarcoidosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (A) typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and is characterized by a predominantly basal distribution of fibrosis.

###Answer:",A,"ACE inhibitors primarily exert their beneficial effects in heart failure by promoting vasodilation, reducing afterload, and improving cardiac function.",Vasodilation,Diuresis,Inotropic stimulation,Antiarrhythmic effect,Artery,A,"A. Vasodilation

Rationale: ACE inhibitors work by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. By reducing the levels of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors cause vasodilation, which reduces peripheral resistance and afterload on the heart, thereby improving cardiac function in heart failure. Additionally, ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which further contributes to their vasodilatory effects.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient is hemodynamically unstable with signs of shock (tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea) and severe abdominal trauma. The next best step would be to administer intravenous fluid resuscitation to stabilize his vital signs before further evaluation or intervention. This would help to improve his perfusion and oxygenation, reducing the risk of organ failure and death. While an urgent exploratory laparotomy may be necessary, it should not be done without first stabilizing the patient.

Mechanisms for evasion of the host immune response include the production of an antiphagocytic capsule, sequestering of host antibodies or antigen masking by Protein A, biofilm formation, intracellular survival, and blocking chemotaxis of leukocytes.

Protein A binds Fc fragments of antibodies and prevents opsonization and phagocytosis.

Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive bacteria (stained purple by Gram stain) that are cocci-shaped and tend to be arranged in clusters described as ""grape-like.""",Endotoxin,Protein A,Flagella,M protein,Protein M,B,"B

Rationale: The description of the pathogen as beta-hemolytic, catalase-positive, and coagulase-positive indicates that it is Staphylococcus aureus. This organism possesses a number of virulence factors, including protein A, which is a surface protein that binds to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and prevents opsonization. This makes it difficult for the host's immune system to recognize and eliminate the bacteria.",True,model6

An x-ray was done, which revealed the fracture of the humerus. On examination, he has a weakness of the right shoulder abduction and the right shoulder external rotation. However, he has good strength in the forearm and the hand muscles. Which structure is most likely affected?
Correct answer
Well done!
You answered succ
###Options:
A.  Axillary nerve
B.  ulnar nerve
C.  radial nerve
D.  median nerve
E.  Lower brachial plexus

###Answer:",A,"This is a classical scenario of the axillary nerve injury, which occurs most commonly due to anterior dislocation of the shoulder or fracture of the humerus.

The diagnosis is initially made on a neurological exam. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and the teres minor, which are responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation, respectively.

A sensory deficit of the skin over the inferior portion of the deltoid, usually known as the regimental badge area, could be seen. Paresthesias along the route of the axillary nerve could also be reported. In long-standing cases, deltoid muscle atrophy can occur, giving the shoulder a much-flattened appearance.",Axillary nerve,ulnar nerve,radial nerve,median nerve,Lower brachial plexus,A,"A.  Axillary nerve

Rationale: The patient has weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation, which suggests that the axillary nerve is affected. The axillary nerve (C5-C6) is responsible for innervating the deltoid muscle, which is responsible for shoulder abduction, and the teres minor muscle, which is responsible for shoulder external rotation. The patient has good strength in the forearm and hand muscles, which rules out the involvement of radial, ulnar, or median nerves. The lower brachial plexus is also not involved as it affects the hand and forearm muscles.",True,model6

Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease in African populations. HBV is endemic in many parts of Africa, and chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the African region has the highest prevalence of chronic HBV infection, with an estimated 80 million people infected.

###Options:
A.  Supravalvular aortic stenosis
B.  Ventricular septal defect
C.  Coarctation of the aorta
D.  Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return

###Answer:",D,The usual venosus defect is located in the upperatrial septum and is contiguous with the a cava.

Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return

Rationale: Sinus venosus atrial septal defects are often associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), which is a congenital anomaly where one or more pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or a systemic vein instead of the left atrium. This is because the sinus venosus atrial septal defect forms when the sinus venosus fails to incorporate into the right atrium, leading to a defect in the atrial septum and an increased risk of anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Rationale: The patient has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with QRS width >150ms, which is an indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT has been shown to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and improve survival in patients with HFrEF and LBBB. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with HFrEF, but it is not the next step in management for this patient. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is not indicated in this patient as there is no mention of coronary artery disease.

The best initial treatment approach would be to start empiric antibiotic therapy, covering for both Chlamydia and gonorrhea, while awaiting the results of further diagnostic tests, such as PCR or culture for these organisms. Additionally, it is essential to counsel the patient on safe sexual practices and to encourage her to notify her sexual partners to seek evaluation and treatment.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). The patient presents with symptoms such as adnexal pain, cervical motion tenderness, direct abdominal tenderness, elevated temperature, and elevated white blood cell count, which are all consistent with PID. Ectopic pregnancy may also present with similar symptoms, but the use of barrier contraception makes it less likely. Endometriosis typically presents with dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain, while a UTI would not typically cause adnexal pain. A ruptured corpus luteum cyst would not typically present with cervical motion tenderness or direct abdominal tenderness.",Ectopic pregnancy,Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),Endometriosis,Urinary tract infection (UTI),Ruptured corpus luteum cyst of the ovary,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, including bilateral adnexal pain, cervical motion tenderness, direct abdominal tenderness, fever, and elevated white blood cell count, are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is a common complication of sexually transmitted infections, and it is likely that the patient's use of barrier contraception was not effective in preventing the transmission of the infection. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms as well. Ectopic pregnancy would typically present with unilateral adnexal pain, and endometriosis would not typically cause fever or elevated white blood cell count. Urinary tract infection would not typically cause adnexal pain or cervical motion tenderness. Ruptured corpus luteum cyst of the ovary would typically cause unilateral adnexal pain and may not cause fever or elevated white blood cell count.",True,model6

###Answer:",E,"Anorectal malformations (ARMS) are also known as imperforate anus (IA). This is an umbrella term for a group of birth defects which affect the anorectal area.During a normal bowel movement, solid waste passes from the colon (large intestine) to the rectum (the final section the colon) and through the anus. When a child has an ARM, the rectum and the anus do not develop properly.Some types of ARM can cause constipation, faecal and / or urinary incontinence, infections and other problems. Some of these problems are very minor and easy to treat, with great long-term prognosis. Others are complex and affect multiple areas of life, such as sexual function and urinary and bowel control.",This is an anorectal malformation with a recto-urethral fistula.

Perineal cutback indicated for urgent decompression,"This is rectal atresia, a defunctioning colostomy is needed","This is an anorectal malformation with a recto urethral fistula, urgent defunctioning colostomy needed",E,"E

Rationale: The presence of meconium in the urethra indicates a communication between the rectum and urethra, which is a characteristic of high anorectal malformations. In this case, the anus is not visible, indicating that the rectum does not open onto the perineum. This is a high anorectal malformation with a recto-urethral fistula.

Rationale: Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating the body's sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. It is released in response to darkness and promotes sleepiness, while its levels decrease with exposure to light. Melatonin levels typically rise in the evening, helping to induce sleep, and decrease in the morning, allowing for wakefulness. The other options are not directly responsible for regulating the sleep-wake cycle: cortisol is involved in the body's response to stress, insulin regulates blood sugar levels, growth hormone promotes growth and development, and thyroxine is involved in regulating metabolism.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Presence of positive hepatitis E antigen
B.  Presence of positive antihepatitis B core antibody
C.  Presence of elevated liver function tests
D.  Presence of positive antihepatitis B surface antibody

###Answer:",A,"This patient has tested positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen, indicating an ongoing infection with the hepatitis B virus, and therefore, remains infectious as the virus is actively replicating. Liver function tests can differentiate between chronic carrier status, where LFT levels are normal, and active hepatitis, characterized by elevated LFT levels. Additionally, hepatitis antibodies can provide insights into whether the hepatitis is acute or chronic.The presence of hepatitis B e antigen significantly increases the risk of transmission. Therefore, it is imperative that regardless of the presence of the e antigen, newborns should receive hepatitis B immune globulin at birth to shield them from immediate exposure. Subsequently, they should undergo vaccination against hepatitis B for lifelong immunity.Hepatitis B infections in neonates often lead to serious complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",Presence of positive hepatitis E antigen,Presence of positive antihepatitis B core antibody,Presence of elevated liver function tests,Presence of positive antihepatitis B surface antibody,,A,"A

Rationale: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus occurs in 10-20% of cases if the mother is infected in the first trimester, 20-30% if infected in the second trimester, and 60-90% if infected in the third trimester. The presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the mother's blood increases the risk of vertical transmission, as it indicates high levels of viral replication and infectivity. In contrast, the presence of anti-HBc (core) antibody indicates previous or ongoing infection but does not necessarily imply high viral loads. Elevated liver function tests are a sign of liver damage but do not directly affect transmission risk. The presence of anti-HBs (surface) antibody indicates immunity to HBV and would actually decrease transmission risk.",True,model6

D.  A diagnostic endometrial sampling is not necessary
E.  A pap smear is necessary before the definitive management

###Answer:",D,"Diagnostic endometrial sampling is necessary in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding to r/o endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.The other statements are generally true:History of exogenous estrogen administration is important to assess as it can be a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, which can cause postmenopausal bleeding.Assessment of BMI is relevant as obesity is a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.A Pap smear may be necessary as part of the evaluation, to r/o other causes of pv bleeding like cervical cancer",History of exogenous estrogen administration,Assessment of body mass index,perform a glucose tolerance test,A diagnostic endometrial sampling is not necessary,A pap smear is necessary before the definitive management,D,"D

Rationale: Postmenopausal bleeding is a common presentation in gynecology practice. In evaluating and managing a patient with postmenopausal bleeding, it is essential to consider the possibility of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia. Therefore, a diagnostic endometrial sampling is necessary to rule out these conditions. A history of exogenous estrogen administration and assessment of body mass index are important as they can contribute to the development of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Additionally, patients with postmenopausal bleeding may have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hence the need to perform a glucose tolerance test. A pap smear may not be necessary before the definitive management, especially if the bleeding is from the uterus.",True,model6

B.  Eating a few low-sodium crackers before getting out of bed
C.  Avoiding the intake of liquids in the morning hours
D.  Eating six small meals a day instead of thee large meals
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"Using bicarbonate would increase the amount of sodium ingested, which can cause complications. Eating low-sodium crackers would be appropriate. Since liquids can increase nausea avoiding them in the morning hours when nausea is usually the strongest is appropriate. Eating six small meals a day would keep the stomach full, which often decrease nausea.",Taking 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in an 8-ounce glass of water,Eating a few low-sodium crackers before getting out of bed,Avoiding the intake of liquids in the morning hours,Eating six small meals a day instead of thee large meals,None of the above,C,"C

Rationale: The nurse should question option C, ""Avoiding the intake of liquids in the morning hours."" Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms experienced by many women during early pregnancy, often referred to as morning sickness. Encouraging the client to drink plenty of fluids is important to prevent dehydration. The other options are all appropriate interventions for managing morning sickness. Bicarbonate of soda can help neutralize stomach acid and alleviate nausea. Eating small, frequent meals or snacks, such as crackers, can help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce nausea.

###Answer:",A,"Obesity is a well-established risk factor for GERD because excess weight can put pressure on the stomach, leading to increased likelihood of acid reflux.",Obesity,Regular exercise,Low-fat diet,Smoking cessation,"Consuming small, frequent meals",A,"A

Rationale: Obesity is a known risk factor for developing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is because excess abdominal fat can put pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, causing it to relax and allow stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, leading to symptoms of GERD. Regular exercise, a low-fat diet, smoking cessation, and consuming small, frequent meals are all lifestyle modifications that can help alleviate GERD symptoms, but they are not risk factors for developing the condition.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Goiter
B.  Cretinism
C.  Tetany
D.  All of the above
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"This answer is correct because goiter is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is commonly caused by an iodine-deficient diet, which leads to the overgrowth or hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. This can result in a visibly swollen neck and can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or breathing. Cretinism refers to a condition caused by severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy, leading to stunted growth and intellectual disability. Tetany is a condition characterized by muscle spasms and twitching, often caused by low levels of calcium in the blood. None of these conditions specifically involve the enlargement of the thyroid gland like goiter does.",Goiter,Cretinism,Tetany,All of the above,None of the above,A,"A

Rationale: A goiter is an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can result from an iodine-deficient diet. When there is a lack of iodine, the thyroid gland cannot produce thyroid hormones, leading to an increase in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland. This increased TSH production stimulates the thyroid gland to grow, resulting in an enlargement of the gland, or goiter.",True,model6

Their history is significant for alcohol use disorder. Vital signs are temperature 38.9 C (102 F), heart rate 100 bpm, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, coarse crackles are present in the lower lobe of the right lung. A chest x-ray demonstrates an irregular cavity with an air-fluid level in the lateral part of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe of the lung. An elevated white blood cell count is present on the laboratory panel. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the pulmonary finding?
###Options:
A.  Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection
B.  Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions
C.  Pulmonary fungal infection
D.  Pulmonary tuberculosis
E.  sarcoidosis

###Answer:",B,"Lung abscesses are more common in immunocompromised hosts (HIV-AIDS, post-transplantation, or those receiving prolonged immune suppressive therapy). Lung abscesses are also common in those patients with a high risk for aspiration, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Lung abscess is included in infections such as necrotizing pneumonia and lung gangrene, which is characterized by multiple abscesses.

Patients with alcohol use disorder are more prone to develop lung abscesses due to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Abscesses that occur after oropharyngeal aspiration are localized in posterior segments of the lungs, and there are no patterns for hematological dissemination of lung abscesses. Common sites for lung abscess are the apical segment of the lower lobe of the right and sometimes of the left lung, then the lateral part of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, and the middle lobe in case of vomiting and aspiration in the prone position. This is typically for patients with alcohol use disorder. Seventy-five percent of all lung abscesses are located in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe or the apical segment of the lower lobe of both lungs.

Depending on the patient's immune status, a lung abscess can be indolent or symptomatic. History should focus on finding patients at risk of aspiration (impaired cognition, loss of bulbar motor function, immobility), causes of immune incompetence, oral or rectal instrumentation, intravenous drug use, and recent upper respiratory illness. Patients could present with fevers, chills, weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, or a cough, which might be productive or non-productive, based on the closeness of the abscess to the airway.

In tuberculosis, mostly the upper lobes of the lungs are involved.",Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection,Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions,Pulmonary fungal infection,Pulmonary tuberculosis,sarcoidosis,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, particularly the foul-smelling sputum, and the radiographic finding of an irregular cavity with an air-fluid level in the lung suggest a diagnosis of lung abscess. The most common cause of lung abscess is aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, especially in patients with impaired consciousness or swallowing dysfunction, such as those with alcohol use disorder. The presence of anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus, in the sputum would further support this diagnosis.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"The clinical presentation, including a history of nosebleeds and easy bruising, along with laboratory findings of normal platelet count, normal platelet adhesion to ristocetin (indicating normal von Willebrand factor function), and normal platelet morphology, suggests a qualitative platelet disorder.Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, also known as integrin ±IIb²3, is a platelet surface receptor that plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation by binding to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, facilitating platelet-to-platelet interactions. Deficiency or dysfunction of Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa can impair platelet aggregation, leading to a bleeding tendency, as seen in this patient.Therefore, the most likely cause of the findings in this patient is a defect in (C) Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa.",Factor VII (proconvertin),Fibrinogen,Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa,Granule storage poo,von Willebrand factor,B,"B.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of afibrinogenemia, an inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency of fibrinogen. The patient's platelet count is normal, and platelet morphology is normal, ruling out thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction disorders. The normal response to ristocetin rules out von Willebrand disease. The absence of aggregation in response to thrombin suggests a defect in the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, which is the formation of a fibrin clot. This is consistent with a deficiency of fibrinogen.

Rationale: Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1). It is commonly seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism, but it can also occur in people with other conditions, such as gastrointestinal disorders, HIV/AIDS, and cancer. Thiamine is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and nerve function.

Rationale: The correct answer is D. Mother group O Rh- baby group A Rh. 

The risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is highest when the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the mother's immune system produces antibodies against the Rh antigen on the baby's red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and jaundice. In this scenario, the mother is O Rh- and the baby is A Rh+, which means the baby has the Rh antigen and the mother does not. This combination has the highest risk of HDN and jaundice.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Activation of mutations of TSH receptors
B.  Increased serum thyroglobulin concentration
C.  Ischemic injury to the hypothalamus
D.  Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid
E.  Presence of TSH receptor autoantibodies

###Answer:",D,"Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid is indeed a characteristic feature of autoimmune thyroiditis, also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, lymphocytes infiltrate the thyroid gland, leading to destruction of thyroid follicles and subsequent hypothyroidism. However, in the context of the patient's symptoms of palpitations, heat intolerance, and an undetectable TSH concentration along with elevated T4 and T3 levels, hyperthyroidism is the more likely diagnosis.Therefore, while lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid may be a mechanism in other thyroid disorders, it is not the most likely mechanism in this patient's case of hyperthyroidism. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are more consistent with postpartum thyroiditis, which is often characterized by transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism due to lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. Therefore the correct answer is (D)",Activation of mutations of TSH receptors,Increased serum thyroglobulin concentration,Ischemic injury to the hypothalamus,Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid,Presence of TSH receptor autoantibodies,D,"D

Rationale: This patient is likely experiencing postpartum thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that can occur in women after childbirth. The symptoms described are consistent with hyperthyroidism, and the laboratory values support this diagnosis. Postpartum thyroiditis is thought to occur due to a reactivation of autoimmune thyroiditis that was suppressed during pregnancy. The lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland leads to the release of preformed thyroid hormone, causing the hyperthyroid symptoms. The patient's symptoms will likely resolve on their own, but beta blockers may be used to control symptoms in the short term.

Rationale: Sporadic worldwide epidemics occur with influenza virus type A due to antigenic shift. Antigenic shift is a sudden, significant change in the antigenic properties of the influenza virus, resulting in a new strain that the host population has little to no immunity against. This leads to widespread infection and potentially severe epidemics.

Which of the following is not a recommended treatment?
###Options:
A.  High fiber diet
B.  Increased water intake
C.  Stimulant laxatives
D.  Warm sitz baths
E.  low fiber diet

###Answer:",C,"Conservative therapy is considered the first-line treatment for symptomatic hemorrhoids. This includes increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and increased water intake. These modifications can decrease straining and the sheering pressure associated with passing stool, which alleviates congestion and allows hemorrhoid cushions to return to their natural, nonpathological state.

Increased fiber intake can help with symptomatic hemorrhoids but must be accompanied by adequate water intake to ensure that stool is not just bulky, but also soft. Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that softens stool by increasing the water content of stool.

mental status over the past several months. Her vision is normal. A CT scan reveals
hydrocephalus, but the lumbar puncture pressure is unexpectedly low. What does she
have?



###Options:
A.  Meningitis
B.  Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
C.  Sigmoid sinus thrombosis
D.  Echinococcus
E.  Glioblastoma multiforme

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is B. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an increase in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain's ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus. However, unlike other forms of hydrocephalus, the pressure of CSF within the ventricles remains within the normal range.

The classic triad of symptoms in NPH includes gait disturbance (imbalance), cognitive impairment (deterioration of mental status), and urinary incontinence. Vision is typically not affected in NPH.

The unexpected finding of low lumbar puncture pressure in the context of hydrocephalus is consistent with NPH. In NPH, the pressure of CSF in the ventricles may be elevated, but the pressure in the lumbar subarachnoid space, where the lumbar puncture is performed, may be normal or low.

The other options listed are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings:

A. Meningitis: Meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and often, altered mental status. However, it is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

C. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis: Sigmoid sinus thrombosis typically presents with headache, ear pain, and sometimes, focal neurological deficits. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

D. Echinococcus: Echinococcus infection (hydatid disease) typically presents with cystic lesions in various organs, depending on where the larvae settle. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

E. Glioblastoma multiforme: Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain tumor that typically presents with focal neurological deficits, seizures, and sometimes, raised intracranial pressure. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and findings described, the most likely diagnosis is Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (option B).

Rationale: 
Gamma radiation damages the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules, leading to sterility. In this case, the patient has normal levels of testosterone, indicating that the Leydig cells are intact and functioning normally. However, the destruction of the germinal epithelium would lead to an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, not a suppression.

Mothers should be advised to continue breast feeding.",Investigation is not required if the baby is breast fed and otherwise well,A high conjugated bilirubin is typical of breast milk jaundice,"The baby's faeces should be pale, grey/white in breast milk jaundice",Parents should be advised to change to formula milk feeds,Jaundice can persist beyond 2 months of age,A,"A. Investigation is not required if the baby is breast fed and otherwise well

Rationale: Breast milk jaundice is a common and benign condition that occurs in breast-fed babies. It typically appears around 7-10 days of age and can last up to 3-4 weeks. In an otherwise healthy baby, no further investigation is required. The bilirubin levels are usually unconjugated, and the baby's stool is typically yellow. Changing to formula milk feeds is not necessary, and jaundice can persist beyond 2 months of age in some cases.",False,model6

A.  A thorough cardiac evaluation is necessary before vaccination
B.  The nasal influenza vaccine is indicated
C.  The influenza vaccine is contraindicated due to his previous history of muscle weakness
D.  Routine vaccination can be given safely
E.  Routine vaccination can't be given safely

###Answer:",D,"The muscle weakness in a young adult with full recovery denotes Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), an immune polyradiculopathy.

The neurological examination and electromyogram will not be helpful after recovering from the condition.

The influenza vaccination is considered safe for this patient as the influenza vaccine did not trigger his GBS.

Rationale: 
The patient has a history of muscle weakness, but it is not specified whether it was related to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a contraindication for influenza vaccination. In the absence of any evidence of ongoing muscle weakness or a family history of muscle diseases, the patient can receive the influenza vaccine safely.

His parents have noticed him limping when walking around the house for the past 2 days. There is no distress when sat, but has complained of pain. Parents deny any trauma. When further history taken, he has had a recent cold. On exam, patient is well, but there is decreased range of movement in the hip.
###Options:
A.  Septic Arthritis
B.  Transient Synovitis
C.  Perthes Disease
D.  Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
E.  Henoch-Schonlein Purpura

###Answer:",B,Based on this history the most appropriate answer. Transient synovitis is suggested by the recent viral infection and pain only on movement of hip. Septic Arthritis is less likely due to him being so well. Perthes disease and JIA are less likely due to the acute timeframe.

A.  Decrease the duration of exercise and increase caloric intake
B.  Maintain the duration of exercise and decrease caloric intake
C.  Combined oral contraceptive pills
D.  Olanzapine
E.  biopentin

###Answer:",A,"Menstrual irregularity is common when a female starts menstruation. It may take several months for menses to get regular, but this patient has had menstrual irregularity for 1 year. Her last menstrual period was 35 days ago. Thus, this patient has developed oligomenorrhea.

Excessive exercise can often lead to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, especially in athletes. It occurs due to the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This patient is also a member of the basketball team. Moreover, her body mass index is 17 kg/m². It shows that the cause of oligomenorrhea in this patient is exercise.

The treatment of exercise-induced oligomenorrhea includes restoring normal body weight. It is done by reducing the intensity of exercise and increasing caloric intake.

Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication given to patients who develop oligomenorrhea due to anorexia nervosa when they do not respond to behavioral modification.

She reports localized pain on the left side that has increased in severity over the last 2 days. She also reports amenorrhea and nausea. On examination, you note a tender adnexal mass on the left. What is the likely cause?
###Options:
A.  Pelvic inflammatory disease
B.  ectopic pregnancy
C.  ovarian cyst
D.  uterine leiomyoma
E.  appendicitis

###Answer:",B,"The pain associated with ectopic pregnancy is often described as colicky, and may radiate to the shoulder if there is a significant hemoperitoneum. Amenorrhea and symptoms of pregnancy are diagnostic clues.",Pelvic inflammatory disease,ectopic pregnancy,ovarian cyst,uterine leiomyoma,appendicitis,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of localized pelvic pain, amenorrhea, and nausea are consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. The presence of a tender adnexal mass on the left side further supports this diagnosis. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube. The symptoms can be similar to those of a miscarriage, but the presence of an adnexal mass and the lack of vaginal bleeding make ectopic pregnancy more likely. While pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can cause pelvic pain, it is typically bilateral and not associated with an adnexal mass. Ovarian cysts can cause pelvic pain, but they are not typically associated with amenorrhea and nausea. Uterine leiomyomas are benign tumors that can cause pelvic pain, but they are not typically associated with an adnexal mass or amenorrhea. Appendicitis can cause pelvic pain, but it is typically associated with abdominal tenderness and guarding, which is not described in this scenario.",True,model6

She further adds that she has gained 10 lbs (4.5 kg) over a short period. The provider suspects that she has hypothyroidism. Further laboratory workup revealed a T4 of 0.3 ng/dL (normal range 0.4 to 1.7 nanograms per deciliter) and a TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) of 12 mU/L (normal range 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units per liter).

###Options:
A.  Free T4 levels
B.  Free T3 Levels
C.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
D.  Total T3 levels
E.  albumin level

###Answer:",C,"TSH is used to adjust the dosage because TSH secretion is sensitive to feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones. Particularly in primary hypothyroidism, TSH is the first laboratory test to be ordered.

As the levels of thyroid hormones normalize, it will improve the levels of TSH to the normal range and increase the free T4 levels to the target range.

Free T4 is helpful in secondary hypothyroidism; however, in primary hypothyroidism, it does add additional information. However, TSH is the best test to titrate the levothyroxine dose.

Free T3 levels are not accurate. Total T3 does not help in the management of primary hypothyroidism",Free T4 levels,Free T3 Levels,Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),Total T3 levels,albumin level,C,"C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

Rationale: The correct answer is C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The patient has hypothyroidism, and the provider has started her on levothyroxine 100 mcg/day. To adjust the dosage of levothyroxine, the provider should measure the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. TSH levels are used to monitor the effectiveness of levothyroxine therapy, as they should decrease to normal levels with adequate replacement. Free T4 levels (A) may also be measured, but TSH levels are a more sensitive indicator of thyroid function. Free T3 levels (B) are not typically used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine. Total T3 levels (D) are not as accurate as free T3 levels and are not commonly used to monitor levothyroxine therapy. Albumin levels (E) are not related to thyroid function and would not be used to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"To reduce the dose of levodopa and its peripheral side effects, the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa, is coadministered. As a result of this combination, more levodopa is available for metabolism by catecholOmethyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa, which competes with levodopa for the active transport processes into the CNS. By administering entacapone (an inhibitor of COMT), the competing product is not formed, and more levodopa enters the brain. The other choices are not appropriate, because neither peripheral decarboxylase nor COMT nor monoamine oxidase metabolizes amantadine or the direct-acting dopamine agonists, ropinirole and pramipexole","Amantadine, carbidopa, and entacapone.","Levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone","Pramipexole, carbidopa, and entacapone","Ropinirole, selegiline, and entacapone.","Ropinirole, carbidopa, and selegiline.",B,"B.

Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of levodopa in the gut and peripheral tissues, thereby increasing the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain. Entacapone is a COMT inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of levodopa in the brain, thereby increasing its duration of action. Therefore, the combination of levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone is a rational treatment plan for Parkinson's disease.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Frontal and occipital
B.  Frontal and parietal
C.  Frontal and mesial temporal
D.  Frontal and lateral temporal
E.  Parietal and Occipital

###Answer:",C,"Traumatic brain injury resulting from motor vehicle accidents typically affects the frontal and mesial temporal areas of the brain. The frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, such as decision-making and problem-solving, as well as personality and behavior. The mesial temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus, is involved in memory formation and emotional regulation. Motor vehicle accidents often involve high-impact forces and sudden deceleration, leading to frontal lobe contusions and damage to the mesial temporal lobe due to its proximity to bony structures like the skull.",Frontal and occipital,Frontal and parietal,Frontal and mesial temporal,Frontal and lateral temporal,Parietal and Occipital,C,"C.  Frontal and mesial temporal

Rationale: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from motor vehicle accidents often involves deceleration or acceleration forces that cause the brain to move back and forth inside the skull. This can result in injury to the frontal and mesial temporal areas, which are more susceptible to damage due to their proximity to the bony ridges and protuberances of the skull. The frontal lobe is particularly vulnerable to injury due to its location near the anterior cranial fossa, and the mesial temporal lobe is susceptible to injury due to its location near the sphenoid bone. This type of injury is often referred to as a ""coup-contrecoup"" injury, where the brain is injured at the site of impact (coup) and also on the opposite side of the brain (contrecoup) due to the deceleration forces.",True,model6

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in women of childbearing age. The discharge is typically milky white or grayish in color, thin and homogeneous, and has a characteristic fishy or amine-like odor. Itching is not a common symptom of BV, which helps to distinguish it from candidiasis. Trichomoniasis is often associated with a greenish-yellow discharge and intense itching, which is not described in this scenario. Malignancy and urinary tract infection are not typically associated with a milky whitish discharge with a fishy odor.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Droperidol
B.  Dolasetron
C.  Prochlorperazine
D.  Dronabinol
E.  Palonosetron

###Answer:",E,"Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that is effective against drugs with high emetogenic activity, such as cisplatin. Although dolasetron is also in this category, its propensity to affect the heart makes it a poor choice for this patient. Droperidol also affects the heart and now is generally a second-line drug used in combination with opioids or benzodiazepines. The antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine, a phenothiazine, is most beneficial against anticancer drugs with moderate to low emetogenic properties.",Droperidol,Dolasetron,Prochlorperazine,Dronabinol,Palonosetron,E,"E. Palonosetron

Rationale: Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is a good choice for this patient because it has a low risk of causing QT interval prolongation, which is important in a patient with cardiac failure. Droperidol and dolasetron are also 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, but they have a higher risk of QT interval prolongation. Prochlorperazine is a dopamine receptor antagonist that can cause orthostatic hypotension, which may worsen cardiac failure. Dronabinol is a cannabinoid that can cause tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension, which may also worsen cardiac failure.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"The patient most likely has croup, which is caused by a paramyxovirus (parainfluenza).

Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can be given via IV or PO. This is the first line of treatment for croup along with oxygenation if needed and epinephrine.

Dexamethasone reduces the length of stay in the hospital as well as the readmission/revisit rate.

The patient does not have a fever or pain at this time. She is having difficulty breathing secondary to croup. Acetaminophen would not be the first line for worsening croup without a fever.

C.  Double-layer closure of the hysterotomy
D.  Closure of the subcutaneous space
E.  none

###Answer:",B,"Urologic injuries, such as to the bladder or ureters, are rare complications of the cesarean section.

Many physicians may choose cesarean section techniques based on tradition rather than evidence.

In several trials, the omission of a bladder flap decreased operative time and did not increase complications such as hematuria, pain, or urinary tract infection. However, bladder injury is rare, and studies have been underpowered to detect whether the omission of the bladder flap changes the incidence of bladder injury.

In patients where the risk of inferior extension of the hysterotomy into the bladder or cervix is higher, such as in women who have been pushing, physicians may choose to create a bladder flap even if that is not their usual technique.",A Pfannensteil skin incision,Creation of a bladder flap,Double-layer closure of the hysterotomy,Closure of the subcutaneous space,none,B,"B. Creation of a bladder flap

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of urinary retention and hematuria after a cesarean section. This is likely due to a bladder injury or laceration during the surgery. Creation of a bladder flap during cesarean section helps to protect the bladder from injury during the procedure. This involves dissecting the bladder off the lower uterine segment, creating a flap that can be retracted out of the way during the hysterotomy.

Eplerenone has a much lower risk of gynecomastia due to improved selectivity for the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Eplerenone is often used to reverse the effects of spironolactone-induced gynecomastia.

Spironolactone should be discontinued as early as possible upon discovery of gynecomastia, but it would be inappropriate to discontinue without replacing with eplerenone given the benefit of aldosterone antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",Discontinue spironolactone,Increase carvedilol,Replace spironolactone with eplerenone,Replace spironolactone with eplerenone,increase spironolactone,C,"C

Rationale: The patient is experiencing bilateral breast enlargement, which is a common side effect of spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic. This is due to the anti-androgenic effects of spironolactone. Eplerenone is a more selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that has a lower risk of breast enlargement and tenderness.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted infection. Undetected infection in mothers with poor antenatal care can result in neonatal morbidity and mortality. The disease develops after an incubation period of 3 to 5 days. The presentation can be conjunctivitis, meningitis, scalp abscess, and sepsis.

Treatment is by intravenous ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg/day or intravenous cefotaxime for 7 days. Administration of intraocular erythromycin as soon as possible after delivery protects against ophthalmia neonatorum.

Antenatal screening of pregnant females who are at high risk for gonococcal infection and prompt treatment prevents the transmission to the fetus. Aerosol transmission, IV lines, or hematogenous transmission via the mother's blood is not seen in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",Hospital-acquired infection through aerosol droplets,Passage through the vaginal canal,Intravenous lines,Hematogenous spread via the mother's blood,none of the above,B,"B

Rationale: The patient is a 4-day-old infant presenting with purulent discharge from both eyes. The Gram stain of the ocular discharge reveals polymorphonuclear cells and intracellular Gram-negative diplococci, which is consistent with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The infant likely contracted the disease during passage through the vaginal canal of an infected mother. This is a common mode of transmission for gonococcal conjunctivitis. The lack of prenatal care in the mother's history also increases the likelihood of undiagnosed gonococcal infection.",True,model6

The histology may be imprecise, and these changes may represent a normal process in the breast. It is thought not to be a risk factor for most women 

",(A)	benign intraductal papilloma,(B)	endometriosis of the breast,(C)	fibrocystic changes,(D)	lobular carcinoma in situ,(E)	infiltrating ductal carcinoma,C,"C

Rationale: Fibrocystic changes, also known as fibrocystic disease, is a benign breast condition characterized by a combination of microscopic cysts, papillomatosis, fibrosis, and ductal hyperplasia. It is a common condition that affects many women, especially during their reproductive years. The symptoms include breast pain, tenderness, and swelling, which are often cyclic and related to the menstrual cycle. The diagnosis is usually made by microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen, which shows the characteristic features mentioned above. Benign intraductal papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the epithelial cells lining the ducts of the breast, whereas endometriosis of the breast is a rare condition in which endometrial tissue is found in the breast. Lobular carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma are both types of breast cancer.",True,model6

E.  Right ventricle

###Answer:",B,"Left atrial myxomas are also relatively common and account for a significant portion of all myxomas. They are often attached to the interatrial septum, particularly around the fossa ovalis. Left atrial myxomas can cause symptoms such as syncope, dyspnea, and palpitations due to obstruction of blood flow through the mitral valve or embolization of tumor fragments.While right atrial myxomas are more common overall, left atrial myxomas are also frequently encountered. Given the clinical presentation of fainting episodes and the echocardiographic finding of a pedunculated intracardiac mass, the possibility of a left atrial myxoma should indeed be considered.Therefore, option (B) Left atrium is a plausible location for the intracardiac mass depicted in the scenario.",Interventricular septum,Left atrium,Left ventricle,Right atrium,Right ventricle,B,"B

Rationale: The photomicrograph shows a papillary fibroelastoma, which is a benign cardiac tumor. Papillary fibroelastomas are typically attached to the endocardium by a pedicle and have a fond-like appearance. They are most commonly found in the left atrium, particularly on the mitral valve. The symptoms in this patient are consistent with a tumor that is obstructing blood flow and causing syncope. The presence of an S3 and S4 on cardiac examination suggests that the patient has a certain degree of heart failure, which would also be consistent with a tumor that is obstructing blood flow.",True,model6

The patient also complains of tiredness and feeling short of breath after climbing a few steps. Physical examination shows increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, and pedal edema. The provider prescribed a medication that is known to increase intracellular calcium levels and has a positive ionotropic effect on the heart. What is the mechanism of action of the drug prescribed by the provider?
###Options:
A.  Decreasing conduction at the sino-atrial node
B.  Blocking calcium channels
C.  Blocking beta receptors
D.  Inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium ATPase) pump
E.  Blocking alpha receptors

###Answer:",D,"Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K ATPase) pump, which is an enzyme that is needed for the active transport of sodium outside and potassium inside the myocardial cell membrane. This creates a transmembranous gradient, which is used by Na-Ca (sodium-calcium) antiporter. Inhibiting Na-K ATPase leads to increased intracellular sodium; this, in turn, decreases the function of the sodium antiporter that brings sodium ions inside the cell and exports calcium outside the cell. Decreased transmembrane gradient decreases the activity of the Na-Ca antiporter, thus increasing intracellular Ca, which also leads to Ca-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Increased intracellular calcium results in an increased force of contraction. Intracellular calcium leads to the prolongation of phases 4 and 0 of the cardiac action potential. It also acts on the atrioventricular node by increasing the parasympathetic tone mediated by the vagus nerve, therefore decreasing the heart rate.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of digoxin include increased PR interval, decreased QT interval, and inversion of the T wave.

Digoxin causes minimal vasodilation due to decreased sympathetic discharge.",Decreasing conduction at the sino-atrial node,Blocking calcium channels,Blocking beta receptors,Inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium ATPase) pump,Blocking alpha receptors,D,"D. Inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium ATPase) pump

Rationale: The symptoms described in the patient are indicative of heart failure, and the provider has prescribed a medication that increases intracellular calcium levels and has a positive ionotropic effect on the heart. The only medication that fits this description is digoxin, a cardiac glycoside. Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which leads to an increase in intracellular sodium levels. This, in turn, increases intracellular calcium levels through the sodium-calcium exchanger, resulting in a positive ionotropic effect on the heart. This increases the force of contraction of the heart, which is beneficial in heart failure.",True,model6

Rationale: Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used for hypertension and has no role in anticoagulation. The other options are all oral anticoagulants used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban are all renally cleared and require dose reduction in patients with moderate to severe kidney disease.

He has had two bloody stools and vomiting. The infant is irritable with a temperature of 38.5 C. The abdomen seems tender, and the child continues crying. What is the best initial diagnostic test?
###Options:
A.  Stool for giardia antigen, ova, and parasites
B.  Air contrast enema with a baseline scout decubitus view
C.  Abdominal ultrasound
D.  Plain radiograph of the abdomen
E.  CT scan

###Answer:",C,"The patient, being between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, most likely has ileocolic intussusception.

The history is consistent with this diagnosis, and occasionally a sausage-shaped mass can be palpated in the right upper quadrant. Plain radiographs may be helpful to exclude perforation or when ultrasound is not immediately available and can show characteristic bowel obstruction. The ""target sign,"" consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on the right kidney, represents peritoneal fat surrounding and within the intussusception. The ""crescent sign"" is a soft tissue density representing the intussusceptum projecting into the gas of the large bowel, obscured liver margin, or lack of air in the cecum.

Air, saline, or barium enema can reduce the intussusception or make the diagnosis but are not usually the first study ordered because there is a risk of bowel rupture. Prior to the enema, the patient must be cleared for surgery. There is no preparation required for an abdominal ultrasound.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with an acute abdomen, specifically an intussusception. The best initial diagnostic test would be a plain radiograph of the abdomen to rule out free air in the abdomen, which would indicate a perforation. The radiograph can also show signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated bowel loops or a soft tissue mass. If the radiograph is negative, an air contrast enema (Option B) would be the next step to diagnose and potentially treat the intussusception.

D.  (D)	luteinizing hormone (LH)
E.  (E)	gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)

###Answer:",C,"In the first half of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium is influenced by estrogen. The endometrium develops from its basal layer (basalis). Estrogen makes the lining proliferate (hence, the proliferative phase). At midcycle, estrogen production continues, but with ovulation, progesterone is also produced, which causes coiling of the endometrial arteries and compaction of the endometrium. Progesterone also causes endometrial glands to secrete (hence, secretory phase). Although it is true that gonadotropins (GnRH, FSH, and LH) serve as signals for this process, they have little direct effect on endometrium. In the normal postmenopausal woman, gonadotropins are elevated, but the endometrium does not change because no estrogen or progesterone is produced  ",(A)	progesterone,(B)	follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),(C)	estrogen,(D)	luteinizing hormone (LH),(E)	gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH),C,"C

Rationale: The correct answer is C. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium becomes thicker and rebuilds largely in response to estrogen produced by the growing follicle. Estrogen stimulates the proliferation and growth of the endometrium, causing it to thicken and become more vascular. This prepares the uterus to implant a fertilized egg.",True,model6

A.  Immediate cesarean delivery
B.  Pelvic examination to assess the station of the fetal head
C.  Immediate forceps delivery
D.  Continue pushing
E.  Abdominal USS

###Answer:",B,"The patient is in the second stage of labor with category 2 fetal heart rate (FHR). An expeditious operative vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery is offered if the intrauterine resuscitative measures are not improving the fetal heart tracings and there are persistent late decelerations with loss of variability. An immediate cesarean is not the next best step.

If recurrent late decelerations with no variability (category 3) persist or are not promptly evaluated and treated, this can lead to increased fetal morbidity and mortality. So, the immediate step is to assess and examine the station of the fetal head if operative vaginal delivery is an option.

Immediate operative vaginal delivery is not appropriate before assessing the station of the fetal head if operative vaginal delivery is an option.

Recurrent late decelerations can be precarious as they can become hazardous if not promptly evaluated. Evaluating the entire fetal heart tracing and maternal status is essential. Consideration is necessary to the degree of variability and presence or absence of accelerations, and the underlying cause of the deceleration must be addressed immediately.

###Answer:",A,"The sudden onset of severe chest pain is a classic symptom of AMI. The pain is typically described as crushing, squeezing, or pressure-like and can radiate to the left arm, jaw, or back. The presence of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads on the electrocardiogram is highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction. ST-segment elevation indicates myocardial injury, and the specific leads affected can help identify the area of the heart affected.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The sudden onset of severe chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads are classic signs of an AMI, particularly if it involves the left anterior descending artery. While pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain, it would not typically cause ST-segment elevation. Aortic dissection can cause chest pain, but it would not typically cause ST-segment elevation and would be more likely to cause a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray.

Rationale: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition characterized by atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries, leading to symptoms of intermittent claudication and pain at rest. In a rural African community, access to advanced interventions such as surgical revascularization and endovascular interventions may be limited. Therefore, the most appropriate initial management would be antiplatelet therapy, which has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and improve symptoms in patients with PAD. Additionally, antiplatelet therapy is a relatively low-cost and widely available intervention, making it a more feasible option in resource-limited settings.

E.  Infertility

###Answer:",D,"Secondary dysmenorrhea is the most consistent symptom with a diagnosis of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows into the muscular wall of the uterus. This can cause heavy and painful periods, which is known as secondary dysmenorrhea.

###Options:
A.  Ectopic pregnancy
B.  Ovarian cyst
C.  Endometriosis
D.  Pelvic inflammatory disease
E.  Uterine fibroids

###Answer:",B,"The woman's history of infertility suggests a possible underlying gynecological condition. Ovarian cysts are known to be associated with infertility in some cases. The presence of regular menstrual cycles indicates that ovulation is likely occurring. Ovarian cysts can develop as a result of the normal menstrual cycle when a follicle fails to rupture and release an egg, leading to the accumulation of fluid and the formation of a cyst. The presence of a firm, nontender mass in the right adnexa (the area near the ovary and fallopian tube) is consistent with an ovarian cyst. Ovarian cysts can vary in size and presentation but are often palpable on physical examination.",Ectopic pregnancy,Ovarian cyst,Endometriosis,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Uterine fibroids,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an ovarian cyst. The patient's regular menstrual cycles suggest that she is ovulating, which makes ectopic pregnancy (A) less likely. There is no history of pelvic inflammatory disease (D), and the mass is not tender, which makes PID less likely. Endometriosis (C) typically presents with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Uterine fibroids (E) typically present with abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pressure, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

###Options:
A.  Total pancreatectomy
B.  Sphincteroplasty
C.  Side to side pancreatico jejunostomy
D.  Resecting the tail of pancreas and performing a pancreatojejunostomy

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is:

C. Side to side pancreaticojejunostomy.

In chronic pancreatitis, the characteristic finding of a ""chain of lakes"" appearance in ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) indicates multiple dilated pancreatic ducts resembling a chain of lakes. Management typically involves surgical intervention to alleviate symptoms and complications. Side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy (also known as lateral pancreaticojejunostomy or Puestow procedure) is a surgical technique used to drain the dilated pancreatic ducts, which can help relieve pain and improve drainage in cases of chronic pancreatitis with ductal dilation. ",Total pancreatectomy,Sphincteroplasty,Side to side pancreatico jejunostomy,Resecting the tail of pancreas and performing a pancreatojejunostomy,,C,"C

Rationale: Chain of lakes appearance on ERCP is a feature of chronic pancreatitis where the pancreatic duct is dilated and has a chain-like appearance. This is due to multiple strictures in the pancreatic duct. The management of this condition is a side-to-side pancreatico-jejunostomy (Puestow's operation), which involves anastomosing the pancreatic duct to the jejunum. This allows drainage of the pancreatic secretions into the jejunum, relieving the patient's symptoms.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is Uterosacral + cardinal. The uterosacral and cardinal ligaments play a crucial role in supporting the uterus and upper 1/3 of the vagina. These ligaments connect the uterus to the sacrum and lateral pelvis, providing stability and preventing prolapse.

Rationale: The uterosacral ligaments and cardinal ligaments help uphold the uterus and upper 1/3 of the vagina to the sacrum and lateral pelvis. The uterosacral ligaments are fibromuscular structures that arise from the cervix and upper vagina and insert into the sacrum. The cardinal ligaments are fibrous structures that arise from the cervix and upper vagina and insert into the lateral pelvis.

Her physical examination reveals a hard, immobile 5 x 2 cm mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. On ultrasound, the mass is hypoechoic with irregular borders and septations. An excisional biopsy is performed and the sample is ER+. The patient undergoes bilateral radical mastectomies. Which of the following is the most appropriate adjuvant therapy?
###Options:
A.  Finasteride
B.  Fadrozole
C.  Clomiphene citrate
D.  Letrozole
E.  progesterone

###Answer:",D,"Adjuvant chemotherapy prevents breast cancer recurrence and is indicated in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptive breast cancer with a mass of >1 cm at diagnosis or evidence of metastasis. An increase in cells that express ER is present in a majority of breast cancers. Therefore, a variety of pharmacologic agents have been developed to decrease estrogen production and activity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (like tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (like anastrozole) are approved for use in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer because of their mechanisms related to decreasing estrogen levels.

Letrozole and anastrozole are both third-generation aromatase inhibitors that are the most specific toward targeting aromatase and are the most appropriate drugs of choice when choosing aromatase Inhibitors.

Fadrozole is a second-generation aromatase inhibitor that exhibited less specificity for the enzyme aromatase and has an increase of adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rashes, etc. in comparison to third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Clomiphene citrate is a drug that induces ovulation in patients with infertility or PCOS.",Finasteride,Fadrozole,Clomiphene citrate,Letrozole,progesterone,D,"D. Letrozole

Rationale: The patient has an estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Estrogen receptor positive breast cancers are more common in postmenopausal women and are often treated with aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, work by blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues, thereby reducing the amount of estrogen available to stimulate the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Fadrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, but it is not commonly used. Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to induce ovulation in infertility treatment. Progesterone would stimulate the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells, so it would not be an appropriate treatment.",True,model6

He has had multiple episodes of watery, tea-colored loose stools for the past eight months. He often has to get up in the middle of the night and states that fasting does not improve his symptoms. There is no history of blood in stools. However, he has lost about 16 pounds (7.3 kg) in weight during the same period. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, for which he uses subcutaneous insulin. He also has a history of cholecystectomy ten years back, for symptomatic cholelithiasis. His examination reveals a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 12 per minute, and a temperature of 98 F. His systemic examination is unremarkable. His investigations reveal a WBC count of 6,000 per microL, a hemoglobin of 11gm/dl, a platelet count 250,000 per microL, serum ALT 35 IU/L, serum AST 30 IU/L, serum creatinine 0.8 mg /dl, serum sodium 135 meq/l , serum potassium 2.8 meq/l , serum chloride 110 meq/l, serum bicarbonate 18 meq/l, arterial pH 7.2, HbA1c 7.1% , blood sugar random 150 mg/dl and serum CRP 3.5 mg/l. His stool examination is negative for ova and cysts, and stool culture is negative. The stool osmolar gap is calculated to be 40 mOsm/kg. A colonoscopy with biopsy is normal. A contrast-enhanced CT scan reveals the presence of a 3 cm solitary mass in the tail of the pancreas. Urinary 5 hydroxytryptamine level is normal. The patient is treated with fluid and electrolyte supplementation. Which of the following is an appropriate treatment option in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Rifaxamine
B.  Clonidine
C.  Octreotide
D.  Cholestyramine
E.  Lomotil

###Answer:",C,"This patient has presented with chronic, voluminous diarrhea which does not resolve on fasting. The laboratory findings of hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, and normal anion gap acidosis along with normal stool osmolar gap make the diagnosis of secretory diarrhea. The presence of a solitary pancreatic lesion indicates the presence of pancreatic VIPoma. Somatostatin analogs are useful for the management of VIPoma.

VIPomas are functional neuroendocrine tumors that secrete vasoactive intestinal peptide. The signs and symptoms are due to hormonal activation. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide and lanreotide are highly effective in controlling diarrhea in VIPoma.

The initial dose of octreotide is 50-100 mcg subcutaneously every 8 hours, followed by titration as required. Monthy depot intramuscular formulations are available once symptom control is adequate.

Octreotide is usually well tolerated but can have some important side effects such as gall bladder hypomotility. Treatment with glucocorticoids can be considered in individuals with resistant diarrhea. Clonidine is useful in diarrhea associated with diabetic autonomic enteropathy, which is unlikely given the good glycemic control. Diarrhea can be present post-cholecystectomy due to malabsorption of bile salts; it is mainly osmotic and responds to cholestyramine. Small bowel overgrowth can be managed with oral antibiotics such as rifaxamine.",Rifaxamine,Clonidine,Octreotide,Cholestyramine,Lomotil,C,"C

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pancreatic endocrine tumor, specifically a VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-secreting tumor). The symptoms of persistent diarrhea, weight loss, and hypokalemia are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a pancreatic mass on CT scan and the normal urinary 5-hydroxytryptamine level rule out carcinoid syndrome. The treatment of choice for VIPoma is octreotide, a somatostatin analogue that can help control the diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance. Octreotide can also reduce the size of the tumor.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Low dose aspirin
B.  Magnesium sulfate
C.  Indomethacin
D.  Terbutaline
E.  Ibuprofen

Rationale: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and end-organ damage. Magnesium sulfate is the first-line treatment for preeclampsia due to its ability to reduce the risk of eclampsia. It has anticonvulsant properties and can help prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia. Low dose aspirin is used for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women, but it is not the first-line treatment. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can be used to treat polyhydramnios, but it is not used for preeclampsia. Terbutaline is a tocolytic agent used to stop preterm labor, and ibuprofen is an NSAID that can increase blood pressure and worsen preeclampsia.",True,model6

The patient mentioned a family history of heart murmurs in her mother, although the specifics regarding the type or significance were not disclosed. Given this clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is mitral valve prolapse?
###Options:
A.  ASD
B.  Aortic stenosis
C.  Tricuspid regurgitation
D.  Mitral valve prolapse
E.  VSD

###Answer:",D,"Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) occurs when one or both of the mitral valve leaflets billow into the atria at the end of systole. This condition is a congenital abnormality that often becomes apparent during adolescence or later in life. It is more frequently observed in girls than boys and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.Clinical examination reveals a late systolic apical murmur, which may be preceded by a characteristic click. The diagnosis is confirmed using an echocardiogram, which shows prolapse of the mitral leaflets during mid to late systole. Both the ECG and chest x-ray typically appear normal.Interestingly, ²-blockers and digitalis are usually unnecessary for managing MVP. Additionally, the American Heart Association no longer recommends penicillin prophylaxis for dental procedures in patients with mitral valve prolapse.",ASD,Aortic stenosis,Tricuspid regurgitation,Mitral valve prolapse,VSD,D,"D

Rationale: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cause of a late apical systolic murmur, especially in young females. The presence of a clicking sound, which is often described as a mid-systolic click, supports this diagnosis. MVP is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which explains the family history of heart murmurs in the patient's mother. In MVP, the mitral valve leaflets prolapse into the left atrium during systole, producing the characteristic murmur. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation. ASD (atrial septal defect) typically produces a systolic ejection murmur, not a late apical systolic murmur. Aortic stenosis produces a harsh, systolic ejection murmur, usually heard at the base of the heart. Tricuspid regurgitation produces a holosystolic murmur, usually heard at the lower left sternal border. VSD (ventricular septal defect) produces a holosystolic murmur, usually heard at the lower left sternal border.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"Based on the patient's extensive list of symptoms and negative findings on previous evaluations and laboratory studies, it is unlikely that her symptoms are due to a specific medical condition. The patient's anger when asked about depression suggests that her symptoms may be related to a psychological or psychiatric condition. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating a range of conditions, including chronic pain, headaches, and depression. Therefore, CBT would be the most appropriate management option for this patient.

Rationale: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of somatization disorder, which is characterized by multiple, unexplained physical symptoms. The patient's anger when asked about depression and her focus on physical symptoms rather than emotional distress are also consistent with this diagnosis. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a helpful approach in managing somatization disorder, as it can help patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms. The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation. Repeated MRI of the head, lumbar puncture, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Borrelia burgdorferi are not indicated, as the patient has already undergone extensive evaluation without any abnormal findings.

The neonate was delivered via cesarean section to a 21-year-old woman who had no prenatal care. On physical examination, the newborn has a bulging fontanelle. Imaging is consistent with hydrocephalus, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is placed to relieve the excess cerebrospinal fluid. Which of the following represents the normal path of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain?


###Options:
A.  Third ventricle, fourth ventricle, cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, lateral ventricles
B.  Lateral ventricles, third ventricle, cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, fourth ventricle
C.  Cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, third ventricle, lateral ventricle, fourth ventricle
D.  Lateral ventricles, fourth ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, third ventricle
E.  fourth ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius, third ventricle

###Answer:",B,"Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear fluid that is present in the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system around and inside the brain.

Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles. It flows to the third ventricle and then by way of the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle. A disruption in the free flow of this fluid can lead to a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid and cause hydrocephalus.

Approximately 50% to 70% of cerebrospinal fluid is produced in the brain by modified ependymal cells, and the remainder is formed around the blood vessels and along ventricular walls.

Cerebrospinal fluid is generated in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles and leaves the ventricular system via arachnoid villi.

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is B) Elevated cholesterol levels.Elevated cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol), are a primary risk factor for developing coronary artery disease (CAD). LDL cholesterol can deposit in the walls of arteries, forming plaques that can narrow the arteries and restrict blood flow to the heart. This increases the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.

A.  Liver metastases causing hypersplenism
B.  Primary myelofibrosis
C.  Essential thrombocythaemia
D.  Bone marrow metastases
E.  Chronic myeloid leukaemia

###Answer:",B,"The blood count and blood film findings could indicate either primary myelofibrosis or metastatic cancer affecting the bone marrow. However, the presence of significant splenomegaly strongly suggests primary myelofibrosis as the more likely diagnosis. Although the platelet count is elevated, essential thrombocythemia would not typically present with either a leucoerythroblastic blood film or pronounced splenomegaly.",Liver metastases causing hypersplenism,Primary myelofibrosis,Essential thrombocythaemia,Bone marrow metastases,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, such as tiredness and low-grade fever, along with the physical examination finding of splenomegaly, suggest an underlying hematological disorder. The full blood count (FBC) results, including the elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and high platelet count, are consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder. The blood film findings of leucoerythroblastic changes (immature white blood cells and red blood cells in the peripheral blood) and tear drop poikilocytes (abnormal red blood cell shapes) are characteristic of primary myelofibrosis. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's history of breast cancer, which increases the risk of developing myelofibrosis. While liver metastases (option A) could cause hypersplenism, the FBC results and blood film findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Essential thrombocythaemia (option C) is a possibility, but the presence of leucoerythroblastic changes and tear drop poikilocytes favors primary myelofibrosis. Bone marrow metastases (option D) are unlikely given the patient's symptoms and FBC results. Chronic myeloid leukemia (option E) is also a possibility, but the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL1 fusion gene would be necessary to rule out this diagnosis.",True,model6

Periorbital edema (palpebral swelling)

Rationale: 
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected tsetse fly. The infection progresses through two stages: the hemolymphatic stage and the meningoencephalitic stage. 

During the hemolymphatic stage, the parasite multiplies in the blood and lymphatic system, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and lymphadenopathy. 

In the meningoencephalitic stage, the parasite invades the central nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms such as confusion, personality changes, and sleep disturbances. 

Periorbital edema, also known as Winterbottom's sign, is a characteristic feature of African trypanosomiasis, particularly in the meningoencephalitic stage. It is a painless swelling of the eyelids, which can be unilateral or bilateral. 

The other options are not specific to African trypanosomiasis. A painless chancre may occur at the site of the tsetse fly bite, but it is not a common manifestation of the disease.

Rationale: 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. The characteristic features of TTP include:
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (red blood cell destruction)
- Schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on peripheral blood smear (Option A)
- Neurological symptoms (e.g., headache, confusion, seizures)
- Renal impairment

The other options are not characteristic features of TTP:
- Option B: While von Willebrand factor (vWF) is involved in the pathogenesis of TTP, an increase in vWF is not a characteristic feature of the disorder.
- Option C: TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), not an increased platelet count.
- Option D: The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may be prolonged in some cases of TTP due to the consumption of coagulation factors, but this is not a characteristic feature of the disorder.

His wife adds that he gets tired and short of breath more quickly than usual and is starting to look pale. A physical examination reveals a pale older male with no significant findings. A complete blood count shows a microcytic anemia. A fecal occult blood test is positive. A lower gastrointestinal bleed is suspected. Other than colonoscopy, what diagnostic measure can be used to localize a lower gastrointestinal bleed?
###Options:
A.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
B.  MRI of the abdomen

D.  Technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy
E.  CT of the abdomen

###Answer:",D,"This patient has a lower gastrointestinal bleed which can be localized with technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy.

Technetium-99m (99mTc) is classified as a nuclear agent and is a radionuclide isotope that is used primarily for imaging studies and diagnostic purposes.

The radiotracers are not localized to a primary organ and are distributed equally to multiple tissues. Once distributed, they emit photons that can be captured for imaging with single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET).

Severe hypersensitivity-type reactions may occur shortly following the administration of technetium-99m.",Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,MRI of the abdomen,X-ray of the abdomen,Technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy,CT of the abdomen,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which requires localization before treatment. Among the options, technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy (D) is the most suitable choice for localizing a lower gastrointestinal bleed. This nuclear medicine study is sensitive for detecting active bleeding and can help identify the site of bleeding. Colonoscopy is also a suitable diagnostic test for evaluating lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but it may not be able to localize the bleeding site if the bleeding is intermittent or has stopped. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (A) is used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not lower gastrointestinal bleeding. MRI of the abdomen (B) and X-ray of the abdomen (C) are not useful for localizing a lower gastrointestinal bleed. CT of the abdomen (E) may be helpful in identifying the site of bleeding, but it is not as sensitive as technetium-99m red blood cell labeled scintigraphy.",True,model6

Rationale: In an African setting with limited access to surgical facilities, a patient presenting with a strangulated inguinal hernia should initially be managed with administration of intravenous fluids. This is because the patient may be dehydrated and needs to be resuscitated before any surgical intervention. Additionally, intravenous antibiotics may also be administered to prevent sepsis.

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg. On examination, she is noted to have some digital nail pitting and bilateral papilledema. No abdominal bruit is present. Laboratory values are significant for thrombocytopenia, normocytic anemia, increased indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, elevated LDH, BUN 23 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3 mg/dl, and glucose 112 mg/dl. Urine analysis shows mild proteinuria. The patient has no known kidney disease, no history of hypertension and laboratory values from 6 months ago were all within normal limits. On further questioning her medical history, she states that she had some recent onset of heartburn for which she has been taking omeprazole. Which of the following is the most likely cause for her sudden increase in blood pressure?
###Options:
A.  Pheochromocytoma
B.  Scleroderma
C.  Lupus flare
D.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome
E.  urticaria

###Answer:",B,"Given the patient's young age and acute change in her blood pressure, a secondary cause of hypertension has to be considered. The presence of the Raynaud phenomenon, nail pitting on the exam, and heartburn (which may be suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease) are clues that the patient may have underlying systemic sclerosis.

Systemic sclerosis is characterized by abnormal deposition of collagenous material in multiple organ systems. Collagenous deposition can cause thickening of the wall of blood vessels, which in turn causes narrowing of the vascular lumen and the renal arterioles, resulting in hypertension and ischemia, leading to scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). SRC develops in about 5 to 20% of systemic sclerosis patients and is characterized by a sudden onset of hypertension (blood pressure greater than 150/85 mmHg) and a progressive decline in renal function. It may also be characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy, acute retinal changes of malignant hypertension, and new-onset proteinuria or hematuria, as seen in this case. Also, this patient is on chronic steroids, which is an added risk factor for the development of SRC. Other risk factors for SRC include the presence of autoantibodies against RNA polymerase, early-stage disease with diffuse skin involvement, palpable tendon friction rubs on examination, and cyclosporine use.

To confirm the diagnosis, serological tests can be used: autoantibodies against RNA polymerase III or a fine-speckled immunofluorescence pattern on ANA testing. SRC is managed with ACE inhibitors (viz: captopril).

Pheochromocytoma is characterized by episodic tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, and headache. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is primarily seen in children. Sudden onset renal failure is present but usually has a preceding history of diarrhea and has predominant hematological symptoms like thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also, this patient has other clinical features suggestive of scleroderma (e.g., nail pitting, GERD, Raynaud phenomenon). A lupus flare is unlikely, given that the patient is on chronic long-term steroids and has no other features of a lupus flare.",Pheochromocytoma,Scleroderma,Lupus flare,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,urticaria,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory values are consistent with scleroderma renal crisis. The patient has a history of Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a common presenting symptom of scleroderma. The patient's sudden onset of severe hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy (evidenced by thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated LDH), and acute kidney injury are all consistent with scleroderma renal crisis. The patient's lack of history of hypertension and normal laboratory values 6 months prior make pheochromocytoma less likely. Lupus flare is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with scleroderma renal crisis. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is also possible, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory values are more consistent with scleroderma renal crisis. Urticaria is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Combined factor V and VIII deficiency
B.  Factor XII deficiency
C.  Factor V deficiency
D.  Factor VII deficiency
E.  Factor XI deficiency

###Answer:",E,"Factor XI deficiency and factor XII deficiency are the only conditions that lead to prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) without affecting the prothrombin time (PT). However, factor XII deficiency typically does not result in hemorrhage. It's worth noting that deficiencies in factors VIII or IX are more common, and although they are not listed among the options provided, they would be more likely causes of the observed APTT prolongation with normal PT.",Combined factor V and VIII deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Factor V deficiency,Factor VII deficiency,Factor XI deficiency,E,"E. Factor XI deficiency

Rationale: The patient has a prolonged APTT, which is a screening test for the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. The normal thrombin time rules out a fibrinogen deficiency or a heparin effect. The normal PT rules out a factor VII deficiency. The combination of a prolonged APTT and a normal PT suggests a deficiency of a factor in the intrinsic pathway. Factor XII deficiency is not associated with bleeding, as it is not essential for coagulation. Factor V deficiency would also prolong the PT, which is normal in this case. Combined factor V and VIII deficiency would also prolong the PT. Factor XI deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that can cause prolonged APTT and bleeding, especially after trauma or surgery.

Rationale: Hydroxyurea is a medication that has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises, hospitalizations, and transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease. It increases the production of fetal hemoglobin, which can help to reduce the sickling of red blood cells. It is often used in patients with severe sickle cell disease, particularly those who have frequent crises or are at risk for complications such as stroke. Folate supplementation is important in patients with sickle cell disease, but it does not reduce the frequency of crises. Multivitamins are also important for overall health, but they do not have a specific role in reducing sickle cell crises.

###Answer:",A,"This presentation is consistent with neonatal jaundice, likely due to biliary atresia, given the prolonged duration of jaundice, tan-colored stools, and dark brown urine. So, the most likely diagnosis is (A) Biliary atresia.",Biliary atresia,"Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I",Gilbert syndrome,Hemolytic disease of the newborn,Physiologic jaundice,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of jaundice, dark brown urine, and tan-colored stools suggest conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The laboratory results showing a direct bilirubin of 12.5 mg/dL support this diagnosis. The patient's age, lack of hemolytic disease, and normal liver enzymes make options B, C, D, and E less likely. Biliary atresia is a congenital disorder characterized by a progressive inflammatory process that ultimately leads to fibrosis and obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts. It typically presents with jaundice, dark urine, and acholic stools in the first few weeks of life. The patient's mild hepatomegaly and lack of splenomegaly also support this diagnosis.",True,model6

Which of the following is a risk factor for the underlying condition in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Diabetes mellitus type 1
B.  Male sex
C.  His diet
D.  Brain tumor in his father
E.  Diabetes mellitus type 2

###Answer:",C,"This patient presents with symptoms of Wilson disease. Copper-rich food items are a risk factor for this disease in susceptible patients.

A diet low in copper-containing foods is recommended, avoiding mushrooms, chocolate, nuts, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish. The mainstay therapy for Wilson disease is copper chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine.

Patients may complain of abdominal pain, jaundice, weakness, personality changes, depression, migraine headaches, insomnia, seizure, and movement disorder, such as chorea. Hemiballismus may also be present. About 30 to 50% of patients will have neuropsychiatric symptoms, including asymmetrical tremors. Other symptoms may include drooling, ataxia, personality changes, mask-like facies, and clumsiness.

Patients should strictly follow a low-copper diet. The copper-chelating treatment takes up to six months to start working. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial in the neurologic form of the disease. They can help with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, and prevent contractures resulting from dystonia.",Diabetes mellitus type 1,Male sex,His diet,Brain tumor in his father,Diabetes mellitus type 2,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the body. The patient's diet is rich in copper, which is a risk factor for exacerbating the condition. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, and the patient's family history of brain tumor is not a risk factor. Diabetes mellitus type 1 is not a risk factor for Wilson's disease. Male sex is not a specific risk factor, although the disease affects men and women equally. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is also not a risk factor.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Hypo glycemia
B.  Hypo insulinemia
C.  Hypo calcemia
D.  Hyper bilirubine
E.  Poly cythemia

###Answer:",B,"Hypoglycemia is caused by hyperinsulinemia due to hyperplasia of fetal pancreatic beta cells consequent to maternal-fetal hyperglycemia. Because the continuous supply of glucose is stopped after birth, the neonate develops hypoglycemia because of insufficient substrate. Stimulation of fetal insulin release by maternal hyperglycemia during labor significantly increases the risk of early hypoglycemia in these infants.",Hypo glycemia,Hypo insulinemia,Hypo calcemia,Hyper bilirubine,Poly cythemia,B,"B

Rationale: Infants of Diabetic Mothers (IDMs) are at risk for various complications. In the case of gestational diabetes, the infant is at risk for:

* Hypoglycemia (A) due to the high insulin levels produced in response to maternal hyperglycemia, which can lead to neonatal hypoglycemia after birth.
* Hypocalcemia (C) due to the increased insulin production, which can also lead to decreased calcium levels.
* Hyperbilirubinemia (D) due to the increased red blood cell production, which can lead to jaundice.
* Polycythemia (E) due to the increased erythropoiesis, which can lead to an increased red blood cell count.

###Answer:",C,"Insulin is produced by the pancreas and plays a central role in glucose metabolism, facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells and lowering blood glucose levels.",Thyroid hormone,Cortisol,Insulin,Estrogen,Growth hormone,C,"C. Insulin

Rationale: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels in the body. It does this by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly by muscle and adipose tissue, for energy production, glycogen synthesis, and fat storage. Insulin also inhibits glucose production in the liver and promotes the storage of excess glucose as glycogen. The other options are not primarily responsible for regulating blood glucose levels.

###Answer:",D,"The deep surface of the breast lies on the fascia covering the chest muscles. The fascia of the chest is condensed into many bands (Coopers ligaments) that support the breast in its normal position on the chest wall. It is the distortion of these ligaments caused by infiltrative tumors that results in the dimpling appearance of the breast associated with malignancy. At age 56, the most likely cause of this is cancer. Fibroadenomas are usually found in younger women, and neither fibrocystic change nor fibroadenomas usually cause significant dimpling (see Figure 14). Mondors disease is a residual of venous thrombophlebitis of the breast; it is rare. An intraductal polyp may cause a nipple discharge, but is unlikely to result in dimpling especially at a distance from the areola.",(A)	Mondors disease,(B)	benign fibroadenoma,(C)	fibrocystic change,(D)	breast cancer,(E)	intraductal polyp,D,"D

Rationale: Retraction of the breast tissue, especially in the upper-outer quadrant, is a classic sign of breast cancer. The other options are not typically associated with retraction of the breast tissue. Mondor's disease is a benign condition characterized by thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast. Fibroadenoma is a benign tumor that may cause a palpable mass but not retraction. Fibrocystic change is a benign condition characterized by cystic changes in the breast tissue.

His last memory before the episode was shaving under his chin. He is not on any medications and takes only a daily multivitamin. His temperature is 98.6 °F (37 °C), heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. The cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are normal. A sensation of lightheadedness can be reproduced by palpating his carotid pulse for 5 seconds. A basic metabolic panel and ECG are within normal limits. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of the feedback control system that most likely caused this patient's syncopal episode?
###Options:
A.  Baroreceptor hypersensitivity
B.  Chemoreceptor hypersensitivity
C.  Impaired parasympathetic response
D.  Impaired glossopharyngeal nerve signaling
E.  None

###Answer:",A,"This patient, who had a syncopal episode while shaving, likely has carotid sinus hypersensitivity. The pressure on his carotid sinus from the razor while shaving caused transient hypotension, bradycardia, or both.

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is hypothesized to be caused by overly sensitive sensors (carotid baroreceptors), overly responsive controllers (glossopharyngeal nerve, medulla), or effectors (parasympathetic nervous system).

Homeostasis is a regulatory system conceptualized by 5 critical components in a reflex loop: the sensor, setpoint, error detector, controller, and effector.

Various control systems are in place within the body to detect change caused by disruptors and employ effectors to mediate the change to mitigate disruption. Over-activity and under-activity of any control system may potentially be clinically problematic for a patient.",Baroreceptor hypersensitivity,Chemoreceptor hypersensitivity,Impaired parasympathetic response,Impaired glossopharyngeal nerve signaling,,A,"A

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms are consistent with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH), a condition characterized by an exaggerated response to carotid sinus stimulation. This can cause bradycardia, vasodilation, or both, leading to decreased cerebral blood flow and syncope. The carotid sinus is a baroreceptor located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery that helps regulate blood pressure. In CSH, the baroreceptors are overactive, leading to an excessive response to stimulation. In this case, the patient's symptoms were reproduced by palpating his carotid pulse, which is a diagnostic test for CSH.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,"This patient with alcohol use disorder presents with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is used when a patient poorly tolerates lactulose or when lactulose is ineffective.

Rifaximin is an antibiotic that is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. It is thought to reduce ammonia production by targeting and eliminating ammonia-producing bacteria in the colon. 

Rifaximin binds to bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibiting bacterial RNA synthesis.

Neomycin, another antibiotic, was previously used for treating hepatic encephalopathy, but currently, it is not recommended. Additional treatment measures include ornithine-aspartate, which increases the use of ammonia in the urea cycle to produce urea.",Rifaximin,Pantoprazole,Vitamin B12,Hydroxyurea,rifampicin,A,"A.  Rifaximin

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by cognitive impairment, neuromuscular dysfunction, and altered consciousness. The patient's hand flapping when his arms are outstretched is a classic sign of asterixis, which is seen in hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's history of alcohol use disorder and lack of response to lactulose suggest that the patient may have refractory hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbed antibiotic that has been shown to be effective in treating refractory hepatic encephalopathy. It works by reducing the production of ammonia by gut bacteria, which is a key contributor to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is not relevant to this patient's symptoms. Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that is important for nerve function, but it is not directly related to hepatic encephalopathy.

B.  Amoxicillin
C.  Metronidazole
D.  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
E.  Vancomycin

###Answer:",D,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is commonly used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTI in non-pregnant women due to its effectiveness against uropathogens such as Escherichia coli.,Ceftriaxone,Amoxicillin,Metronidazole,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX),Vancomycin,D,"D. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)

Rationale: 
Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in non-pregnant women are typically caused by E. coli, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a first-line agent for treating uncomplicated UTIs due to its high efficacy, low cost, and narrow spectrum of activity. It is effective against the most common causative organisms and has a low risk of selecting for resistant bacteria. Ceftriaxone (A) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may be used for more severe or complicated UTIs, but it is not the first choice for uncomplicated UTIs. Amoxicillin (B) is not effective against many of the organisms that cause UTIs. Metronidazole (C) is primarily used to treat anaerobic infections and is not effective against the aerobic organisms that cause UTIs. Vancomycin (E) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is typically reserved for more severe infections, such as MRSA infections, and is not indicated for uncomplicated UTIs.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  thyroiditis
B.  Graves disease
C.  Toxic thyroid
D.  multinodular thyroid
E.  none of the above

###Answer:",D,It is the only thyroid swelling with irregular surface..,thyroiditis,Graves disease,Toxic thyroid,multinodular thyroid,none of the above,D,"D

Rationale: The presence of anterior neck swelling with palpitation and an irregular surface suggests a multinodular thyroid gland. A multinodular thyroid gland is a condition where the thyroid gland is enlarged and contains multiple nodules, which can cause palpitation and an irregular surface. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, but it typically presents with a diffuse goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) rather than a multinodular gland. Thyroiditis is inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can cause pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with an irregular surface. Toxic thyroid refers to hyperthyroidism, which can cause palpitation, but it is not specific to a multinodular thyroid gland.",True,model6

A.  H. pylori infection
B.  NSAID use
C.  Parasite infestation

###Answer:",A,The most likely cause of gastritis in a previously healthy 50-year-old patient is H. pylori infection. This bacterium is a common cause of gastritis and is associated with the development of peptic ulcers and other gastrointestinal conditions.,H. pylori infection,NSAID use,Parasite infestation,Viral gastroenteritis,,B,"B. NSAID use

Rationale: Gastritis is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the gastric mucosa. The most likely cause of gastritis in a previously healthy 50-year-old patient is NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) use. NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are commonly used medications that can cause gastritis by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which normally protect the gastric mucosa. This can lead to erosion and inflammation of the gastric lining, resulting in gastritis. H. pylori infection is another common cause of gastritis, but it is more likely to cause chronic gastritis rather than acute gastritis. Parasite infestation and viral gastroenteritis are less common causes of gastritis.",False,model6

There is bilateral expiratory wheezing and moderate abdominal tenderness on physical exam. Abdominal computed tomography displays multiple gas-filled cysts in the intestinal wall and evidence of portal venous gas. Which of the following is the next best step in management based on the radiological findings?
###Options:

###Answer:",A,"Pulmonary pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial pneumonia, and asthma can cause an alveolar rupture, releasing gas into the mesenteric vasculature, and causing pneumatosis intestinalis.

The presence of portal venous gas, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, septic shock, emesis, or perforation are poor prognostic factors and indicate surgical intervention.

Other factors indicating poor prognosis are age greater than 60 years of age, amylase level greater than 200 U/L, and leukocytosis.

Conservative management, such as hyperbaric therapy and antibiotics, more specifically metronidazole, is used for patients without poor prognostic factors. Metronidazole is used when pneumatosis intestinalis is caused by Clostridioides difficile.",Surgical consultation,Bronchodilator therapy,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy,Antibiotic therapy,,D,"D.  Antibiotic therapy

Rationale: The presence of portal venous gas in the patient with a history of asthma and abdominal pain suggests pneumatosis intestinalis, which is a sign of bowel ischemia or infarction. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a pH of 7.25 and paCO2 of 70 mmHg, indicating respiratory acidosis. The next best step in management would be to initiate antibiotic therapy to cover for potential bowel flora, such as Bacteroides and Clostridium species, as well as other gram-negative rods. Surgical consultation may also be necessary, but antibiotic therapy should be initiated first. Bronchodilator therapy may help with the patient's respiratory symptoms, but it is not the next best step in management. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not indicated for this condition.",False,model6

Rationale: 
Troponin is the most specific cardiac enzyme for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is a protein complex that regulates muscle contraction and is found in cardiac muscle. Elevated levels of troponin in the blood are highly specific for cardiac damage and are used as a biomarker for AMI. Troponin levels typically rise within 3-4 hours of an AMI and remain elevated for 7-10 days. This makes it a useful diagnostic tool for ruling in or out an AMI.",True,model6

His ECG shows asupraventricular tachycardia with a narrowQRS complex. Heart rate is 160bpm and BP 123/82.Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Valsalva manoeuvre
B.  DC Cardioversion
C.  Intravenous adenosine

###Answer:",C,Vagal manoeuvres are the initial management for haemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia.,Valsalva manoeuvre,DC Cardioversion,Intravenous adenosine,Intravenous metoprolol,Intravenous verapamil,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is presenting with a narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 160 bpm. The initial management of choice for SVT is the Valsalva manoeuvre. This involves increasing intrathoracic pressure by asking the patient to blow into a sphygmomanometer or by performing the Muller manoeuvre. This can help to stimulate the vagus nerve and slow down the heart rate. If the Valsalva manoeuvre is unsuccessful, adenosine can be used as the next step. Cardioversion is not indicated in this scenario as the patient is haemodynamically stable. Metoprolol and verapamil can be used to slow down the heart rate but are not the first line of management.",False,model6

###Answer:",B,"Initially, aggressive fluid resuscitation is required with intravenous isotonic crystalloids (30 mL/kg within 3 hrs).

Additional fluid may be needed based on the results of frequent monitoring.

The goal of resuscitation should be hemodynamic stability and the restoration of adequate tissue perfusion.

Within the first 6 hours of initial resuscitation, one should aim for a central venous pressure (CVP) target between 8 to 12 mm Hg for spontaneously breathing patients while in mechanically-ventilated patients; a CVP between 12 to 15mm Hg should be maintained.",Intravenous colloids.,Intravenous crystalloids.,Intravenous infusion of norepinephrine.,Intravenous infusion of hydroxyethyl starch.,A and B above,B,"B

Rationale: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The physical examination reveals mottled skin and fluid discharge at the surgical site, suggesting wound infection. The laboratory results show a normal blood sugar level, mild anemia, and mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest hypovolemia. Therefore, the next most appropriate step in management is to administer intravenous crystalloids (option B) to restore blood volume and improve perfusion. This should be followed by further evaluation and management of the underlying sepsis, including antibiotics and surgical debridement of the wound site. Options A and D are incorrect because colloids or hydroxyethyl starch are not the first choice for volume resuscitation in sepsis. Option C is incorrect because norepinephrine is a vasopressor that may be used to support blood pressure in septic shock, but it should not be used as a first-line agent for volume resuscitation.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms are consistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by defects in steroid biosynthesis. The most common cause of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which accounts for about 90% of cases. This enzyme is necessary for the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol in the adrenal gland. Without this enzyme, the adrenal gland produces excessive amounts of androgens, leading to virilization of female fetuses.

Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia increase CVP.

Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure.

It leads to fibrosis and a decrease in all lung fields include functional residual capacity (volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration), residual volume (volume of air still remaining in the lungs after a maximum forced expiration), vital capacity (maximum volume of air a person can expel from the respiratory tract after a maximum inspiration), and total lung capacity (the total volume of the lung after a maximum inspiration).",Functional residual capacity,Residual volume,Vital capacity,Total lung capacity,All the above,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disease that can affect the lungs. In sarcoidosis, the granulomas can cause inflammation and scarring in the lungs, leading to restrictive lung disease. Vital capacity (VC) is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled from the lungs after taking a deep breath. It is often reduced in restrictive lung diseases like sarcoidosis, as the lungs become less compliant and have a decreased ability to expand. Functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) may also be reduced, but VC is the most specific indicator of restrictive lung disease.

###Answer:",A,"The most likely cause of yellowish, milky fluid leaking from the nipples of a newborn female is maternal estrogen. Therefore, the correct answer is:(A) Maternal estrogen",Maternal estrogen,Maternal progesterone,Maternal prolactin,Newborn estrogen,Newborn progesterone,A,"A. Maternal estrogen

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question are consistent with witch's milk, a common phenomenon in newborns. Witch's milk, also known as neonatal milk secretion, is caused by the effects of maternal estrogen on the fetal breast tissue during pregnancy. Maternal estrogen crosses the placenta and stimulates the growth and differentiation of the fetal breast tissue, leading to milk production. After birth, the maternal estrogen levels drop, but the effects on the breast tissue persist for a few days, resulting in the secretion of milk from the nipples. This phenomenon is self-limited and resolves on its own within a week or two. Options B, C, E are not directly related to the phenomenon, and option D is incorrect because the newborn's estrogen levels are not high enough to cause milk production.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Addison's Disease
B.  Diabetes Mellitus
C.  Cretinism
D.  Tetany
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Diabetes Mellitus is the correct answer because it is a condition that occurs due to a deficiency of insulin, resulting in high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and the presence of glucose in the urine (glucosuria). In this condition, the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels, leading to various symptoms and complications",Addison's Disease,Diabetes Mellitus,Cretinism,Tetany,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. In diabetes mellitus, the body either does not produce enough insulin or is unable to effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to high blood sugar levels. As a result, the body attempts to eliminate the excess glucose through the urine, resulting in glucosuria (excess glucose in the urine).",True,model6

Abnormally high levels of testosterone in the maternal blood

Rationale: The condition described is XX male syndrome or 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development (DSD). It is a rare congenital anomaly in which an individual with an XX karyotype develops testes and a male phenotype. This occurs due to the presence of high levels of testosterone in the maternal blood during pregnancy, which can be caused by various factors such as a maternal androgen-producing tumor or the use of androgens during pregnancy. The high levels of testosterone can virilize the external genitalia and induce the development of testes in an XX individual.",True,model6

He says that a neighbors child is currently being treated for strep throat. On examination, his temperature is 101.1°F and his other vital signs are normal. He appears well. His throat is erythematous and his tonsils are enlarged, but there are no pharyngeal or tonsillar exudates. He has no cervical adenopathy. He has an occasional cough but his lungs are clear. His abdominal examination is normal.  The presence of which of the following findings is a clinical predictor for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis?
###Options:
A.  Erythematous tonsils
B.  cough
C.  Tonsilar exudates
D.  Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
E.  halitosis

###Answer:",C,"Pharyngitis is a commonly encountered problem in primary care. Patients with upper respiratory symptoms are often convinced that they need antibiotics. Often the etiology is viral, but ruling out bacterial etiology is crucial as the secondary complications can be severe. In terms of group A strep pharyngitis, it is often difficult to make a clinical diagnosis based on one or two factors. Many studies have been performed to guide the clinician in making an empiric diagnosis of group A strep pharyngitis. Fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough and tonsillar hypertrophy are all positive predictors. A patient who has at least two of these criteria should have a rapid strep test or culturewith treatment initiated if the test is positive. When a patient meets three or more criteria and is ill appearing, empiric treatment may be justified. If the patient has a negative rapid strep test and the clinician is suspicious, empiric treatment may be started and throat culture should be obtained. Apatient with a positive culture or rapid strep test should be treated, but a test of cure does not need to be performed. The throat culture has a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%, while the rapid strep test has a sensitivity of 8097% and a specificity of >95%. (Am Fam Physician 2004;69(6): 14651470) The first-line medication for patients diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or first-generation cephalosporins may be used.",Erythematous tonsils,cough,Tonsilar exudates,Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy,halitosis,D,"D

Rationale: The presence of posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is a clinical predictor for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. The Centor criteria, which are used to predict the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis, include the following four criteria: 1) tonsillar exudates, 2) tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, 3) fever by history, and 4) absence of cough. The presence of three or four of these criteria indicates a high likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis. In this case, the patient does not have any of these criteria, making streptococcal pharyngitis less likely.",False,model6

The patient was instructed to discontinue warfarin prior to a unilateral total knee arthroplasty 2 weeks ago. The patient was discharged on the same day of the surgery. He resumed his warfarin 3 days after surgery. His postoperative recovery has been uneventful so far. He began physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening 2 days ago. His symptoms are relieved with sitting. On physical examination, his peripheral pulses and sensation to light touch are intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Spinal stenosis
B.  Claudication
C.  Dissecting aortic aneurysm
D.  Deep venous thrombosis
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"Spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by pain in the legs, calves, thighs, and buttocks that occurs with walking, running, or climbing stairs. Symptoms are often relieved by flexing the spine or sitting. Conversely, lying prone or in any position that extends the lumbar spine exacerbates the symptoms, presumably because of ventral infolding of the ligamentum flavum in a canal already significantly narrowed by degenerative osseous changes.

Middle-aged and older patients are most commonly affected. Typically, the earliest complaint is back pain, which is relatively nonspecific and may result in delayed diagnosis.

Spinal stenosis may be difficult to distinguish from claudication; however, spinal stenosis usually has neurologic deficits, and peripheral pulses are normal.

MRI scanning, with its multiplanar-imaging capability, is currently the preferred modality for establishing a diagnosis and excluding other conditions. Loss of epidural fat on T1-weighted images, loss of cerebrospinal fluid signal around the dural sac on T2-weighted images, and degenerative disc disease are common features of lumbar stenosis on MRI. Treatment for symptomatic lumbar stenosis is usually surgical decompression.",Spinal stenosis,Claudication,Dissecting aortic aneurysm,Deep venous thrombosis,none,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with spinal stenosis, which is a common condition in older adults. The symptoms are exacerbated by walking and relieved with sitting, which is known as neurogenic claudication. The patient's peripheral pulses and sensation to light touch are intact, making peripheral vascular disease and deep venous thrombosis less likely. The patient's recent surgery and resumption of warfarin do not seem to be directly related to the symptoms. Dissecting aortic aneurysm is unlikely given the lack of other symptoms such as chest or back pain.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with heart failure. She has signs of volume overload, including jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, and bibasilar crackles. Her S3 heart sound is also consistent with heart failure. The next step would be to evaluate the patient for any identifiable causes for heart failure, order an echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function and rule out other causes of heart failure, and start afterload reduction therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with pulmonary embolism, and there is no indication for a STAT chest CT or heparin.

###Answer:",A,"Vasoconstriction with the use of epinephrine increases the amount of local anesthetic that can be safely administered by preventing the anesthetic from perfusing systemically.

Vasoconstriction with the addition of epinephrine decreases the amount of procedural blood loss.

Vasoconstriction with the addition of epinephrine prolongs anesthetic effects by maintaining high local concentrations.

Epinephrine can cause heart palpitations and tachycardia in patients sensitive to epinephrine. Patients often mistake this adverse effect for an allergic reaction.","Vasoconstriction localizes anesthetic, decreasing the amount of anesthetic that can safely be administered without localized tissue damage",Decreased procedural blood loss,Prolongation of anesthetic effects,Heart palpitations in sensitive patients,,A,"A

Rationale: Adding epinephrine to a local anesthetic allows for a larger dose of anesthetic to be administered without localized tissue damage. This is because the vasoconstriction caused by epinephrine reduces the systemic absorption of the anesthetic, thereby reducing the risk of toxicity. The other options are all correct. Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, which leads to decreased procedural blood loss. It also prolongs the anesthetic effects by reducing the absorption of the anesthetic.

An anatomic lesion has been ruled out. Further management to control the bleeding should begin with which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists
B.  medroxyprogesterone acetate
C.  Conjugated equine estrogens
D.  OC pills
E.  Transdermal estradiol

###Answer:",D,"ral contraceptive (OC) pills are a common treatment option for abnormal uterine bleeding. They contain synthetic hormones that help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce bleeding. OC pills can help stabilize the endometrium and prevent excessive growth, which can be beneficial for patients with prothrombin deficiency. Other options like GnRH antagonists, medroxyprogesterone acetate, conjugated equine estrogens, and transdermal estradiol may not be the first-line treatment for this specific condition.",Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists,medroxyprogesterone acetate,Conjugated equine estrogens,OC pills,Transdermal estradiol,D,"D

Rationale: The patient is likely experiencing bleeding due to a coagulopathy. The most effective way to control bleeding in this situation is to use a combination hormonal therapy, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which contain both estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen component will help to stabilize the clotting cascade, while the progesterone component will help to regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent further bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (option B) is a progesterone-only medication that may help to regulate the menstrual cycle but will not address the underlying coagulopathy. GnRH antagonists (option A) are used to treat conditions such as endometriosis and fibroids, but are not typically used to control bleeding. Conjugated equine estrogens (option C) are a form of estrogen replacement therapy, but may exacerbate bleeding in this situation. Transdermal estradiol (option E) is also a form of estrogen replacement therapy, but may not provide adequate control of bleeding.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Luteinizing hormone
B.  Follicle stimulating hormone
C.  Progesterone
D.  Estrogen

###Answer:",C,"Progesterone is primarily produced by the corpus luteum in the ovaries and plays a crucial role in regulating the menstrual cycle and supporting pregnancy. During the menstrual cycle, progesterone helps prepare the uterine lining for implantation of a fertilized egg and maintains the pregnancy by supporting the growth and development of the placenta.",Luteinizing hormone,Follicle stimulating hormone,Progesterone,Estrogen,,C,"C.

Rationale: Progesterone is the hormone responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle and supporting pregnancy. It prepares the uterus to implant a fertilized egg and maintains pregnancy. Progesterone levels increase after ovulation and remain high if pregnancy occurs, and decrease if pregnancy does not occur, leading to menstruation. While luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) play roles in the menstrual cycle, they are not directly responsible for supporting pregnancy. Estrogen also plays a role in the menstrual cycle, but it is not the primary hormone responsible for supporting pregnancy.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"This patient has newly diagnosed, acute heart failure.

Acute heart failure can be precipitated or exacerbated by beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, and alcohol.

Increasing cardiac output is the main goal of therapy for a patient with congestive heart failure (CHF).

In the long-term management of CHF, diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, hydralazine plus nitrate, digoxin, and aldosterone antagonists can improve CHF symptoms depending on the severity of the heart failure.",ACE inhibitor,Thiazide,Acetaminophen,Calcium channel blocker,Loop diuretics,D,"D.

Rationale: Calcium channel blockers, particularly verapamil and diltiazem, can precipitate acute heart failure in susceptible individuals, especially the elderly. They can decrease contractility and slow heart rate, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased fluid retention. This is especially true in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease.

She reports having double vision which was intermittent initially but has now become much more frequent. In addition, she becomes breathless very easily and experiences palpitations. On examination, raised, painless lesions are observed on the front of her shins and finger clubbing. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  De Quervains thyroiditis
B.  Thyroid storm
C.  Phaeochromocytoma
D.  Graves disease
E.  Plummers disease

###Answer:",D,"Graves disease (D) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The condition is due to IgG antibodies binding to the TSH receptor, this in turn causes excess production of thyroid hormone. The antibodies also bind to other areas of the body such as the extraocular muscles leading to gaze abnormalities, the shins causing raised lesions known as pretibial myxoedema and rarely the fingers causing clubbing known as thyroid acropachy. These collective signs are only seen in Graves disease, hence it is the only correct answer. De Quervains thyroiditis (A) is a transient thyroid state most likely due to a viral infection. The patient usually complains of a fever and painful neck with some signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, as well as raised ESR levels. A few weeks later, the patient suffers from transient hypothyroid symptoms before returning to a euthyroid state. Phaeochromocytomas (C) are malignancies of the sympathetic nervous system, 90 per cent arise in the adrenal medulla and produce excess catecholamines. The symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma are often similar to hyperthyroidism and include anxiety, palpitations and headache. However, these symptoms are usually intermittent and the main risk to patients is from cardiovascular compromise. Plummers disease (E) is a solitary nodule in the thyroid gland producing excess thyroid hormones. It is usually refractory to antithyroid treatment. A thyroid storm or crisis (B) is a rapid deterioration in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism, often stimulated by a stressor such as infection. Patients present with acute-onset, severe tachycardia, distress and hyperpyrexia.",De Quervains thyroiditis,Thyroid storm,Phaeochromocytoma,Graves disease,Plummers disease,D,"D. Graves disease

Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including visual disturbances, palpitations, and breathlessness.

E.  none

###Answer:",C,"Prompt removal of the foreign body and initiating postcoital contraception should be the next step in managing this patient.

When a levonorgestrel regimen consisting of combined oral contraceptive pills is used as emergency contraception, the patient can be started with any hormonal methods for regular contraception with the quick-start method.

When ulipristal acetate is used, due to concern about the antiprogestin effect, it is recommended that oral hormonal contraceptives are started during the next cycle. IUD is another option, but not acceptable for this patient.

A retained foreign body should be removed immediately when visualized. When there is no clinical evidence of infection in a patient with a monogamous relationship, antibiotics are generally not required to prevent infection. However, if high-risk sexual behavior is suspected, it would be appropriate to screen for sexually transmitted infections. It is essential to start on emergency postcoital contraception if there are condom accidents in midcycle to avoid conception. Sperm can survive in the female genital tract for up to 5 days, and women can conceive if ovulation occurs around that time. Postcoital contraceptives are effective when started earlier and should be offered as soon as possible. Waiting to see another clinician would delay treatment and is not appropriate. This patient has controlled hypertension and is a current smoker. The progestin-only method is preferable over combined oral contraceptive (COC) pills in current smokers.

The patient has a retained condom in her vagina for 16 hours, which increases the risk of unintended pregnancy. She is 13 days postmenstrual, so the risk of pregnancy is high. The patient needs emergency contraception, which is levonorgestrel in this case. Since she is a multiparous woman with regular menstrual cycles and is not planning to have more children at this time, a progesterone-only pill would be a reliable and suitable method of contraception for her. The progesterone-only pill is also a good option as it does not contain estrogen, which may be contraindicated in smokers. It is also a non-invasive method, which suits the patient's preference of avoiding devices.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a bacterial pharyngitis, such as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). The rapid antigen test is not 100% sensitive, so a throat culture is the next step to confirm the diagnosis. The presence of exudates, tender cervical nodes, and the absence of cough support this diagnosis. Antibiotics should not be started empirically without a confirmed diagnosis.

Rationale: Once a fetus at risk is identified in a prolonged pregnancy, the best course of action is to proceed with delivery, regardless of the status of the cervix. This is because the risk of stillbirth and perinatal mortality increases with each passing day beyond 42 weeks of gestation. Therefore, prompt delivery is necessary to prevent any potential harm to the fetus.",False,model6

His history is significant for Hashimoto hypothyroidism, for which he is on levothyroxine replacement. He was recently started on carbamazepine for postherpetic neuralgia. On physical examination, he looks slightly depressed, his responses are slow, and deep tendon reflexes are delayed. What is the most appropriate step in management?
###Options:
A.  Stop carbamazepine and start phenytoin.
B.  Measure thyroid stimulating hormone level.
C.  Measure parathyroid hormone level.
D.  Check carbamazepine level.
E.  MRI brain to look for the extension of the dise

###Answer:",B,"The mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement. The drug of choice is titrated levothyroxine sodium administered orally. It should not be given with iron or calcium supplements, aluminum hydroxide, and proton pump inhibitors to avoid suboptimal absorption. It is best taken early in the morning on an empty stomach for optimum absorption.

The standard dose is 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg per day, but it can vary from one patient to another. Patients < 50 years old should be started on a standard full dose; however, lower doses should be used in patients with cardiovascular diseases and the older population.

In patients > 50 years, the recommended starting dose is 25 mcg/day with reevaluation in 6 to 8 weeks. In pregnancy, the dose of thyroxine needs to be increased by 30%, and in patients with short-bowel syndrome, increased doses of levothyroxine are needed to maintain a euthyroid state.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and slowness of speech, suggest hypothyroidism. The recent introduction of carbamazepine, which induces the metabolism of levothyroxine, is likely the cause of the patient's hypothyroidism. Therefore, measuring the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is the most appropriate step in management. This will help determine if the patient's levothyroxine dose needs to be adjusted.",True,model6

E.  Advise the patient not to become pregnant

###Answer:",E,"ACE inhibitors and statins are known tetragens and should bewithheld in all patients who are pregnant. Because this tetretogenicymay have an impact even during the first trimester, the most prudentapproach would be to withhold both ACE inhibitors and stains duringconception. Low-dose aspirin and beta-blockers are thought to berelatively safe for use in pregnant women, although there may be anassociation between higher doses of beta-blockers and reducedbirthweight, as high dose therapy could theoretically contribute toplacental hypoperfusion.

Rationale: The patient is taking medications that are contraindicated in pregnancy. ACE inhibitors are teratogenic and can cause fetal kidney damage and oligohydramnios. Statins are also contraindicated in pregnancy because they can cause fetal harm. Therefore, the patient should discontinue these medications before becoming pregnant. Aspirin is generally considered safe in pregnancy, but it may increase the risk of bleeding and should be used with caution.

One of the most common types of bacteria found on the prosthetic valve endocarditis is Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The first part of management in patients with endocarditis is to obtain blood cultures. Two sets of cultures are recommended because coagulase-negative staphylococci is a common contaminant. The use of multiple blood cultures improves positive predictive outcomes.

After the blood cultures are obtained, it is important to start empiric antibiotics.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with endocarditis. The patient has a prosthetic valve, which increases the risk of endocarditis. The presence of painful nodules on his hands, known as Osler's nodes, is a classic finding in endocarditis. The next best step is to obtain blood cultures to diagnose the infection and identify the causative organism. This will guide further management and treatment. An echocardiogram (Option B) may be useful in evaluating the valve for signs of infection, but it should not be done before blood cultures are obtained. A skin biopsy (Option C) may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of Osler's nodes but is not the next best step.

Rationale: 
The patient is presenting with a pigmented lesion on the labia with irregular margins. The most appropriate next step would be to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out melanoma. Although the patient is young, melanoma can occur in this age group, and the irregular margins of the lesion are a concerning feature. Discontinuing OCs is not relevant to the management of this lesion.

###Options:
A.  Prostaglandin-F2 alpha
B.  Carbetocin
C.  Oxytocin
D.  Tranexamic acid
E.  Prostaglandin E2

###Answer:",D,"Placenta accreta spectrum disorders describe a group of disorders in which the placenta invades the myometrium of the uterus. While diagnosis before delivery is preferred, it can be diagnosed at the time of delivery when the placenta is not delivered completely. Prior cesarean sections increase the risk of this disorder.

The current recommendation for treatment is cesarean hysterectomy. However, in patients wishing to preserve fertility with placenta accreta, the entire placenta or portion of the placenta can be left in situ. Some providers prescribe methotrexate after delivery to help with placental involution in cases of placenta previa. Nausea and vomiting are the most common adverse effects of methotrexate. Tranexamic acid is a very effective medication that could be used during the cesarean section to reduce the risk of intraoperative blood loss.

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, and it has antifibrinolytic properties.

Syntocinon and carbetocin are tocolytic agents that are used for the active management of the third stage of labour.",Prostaglandin-F2 alpha,Carbetocin,Oxytocin,Tranexamic acid,Prostaglandin E2,D,"D

Rationale: The patient's history suggests that she has a high risk of placenta accreta, a condition where the placenta invades the uterine muscle. This condition is associated with a high risk of bleeding during cesarean section. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic medication that can be used to reduce the risk of bleeding in this situation. It is often used off-label for this indication. Oxytocin (C) is a medication that can cause uterine contractions and is often used to reduce bleeding during cesarean section, but it may not be effective in the setting of placenta accreta. Carbetocin (B) is a long-acting oxytocin analog that is sometimes used to reduce bleeding during cesarean section, but it may also not be effective in the setting of placenta accreta. Prostaglandin-F2 alpha (A) is a medication that can cause uterine contractions, but it is not typically used to reduce bleeding during cesarean section.

Global aphasia is a non-fluent aphasia, and patients have impaired comprehension and unable to repeat.

Transient monocular blindness is commonly seen in atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a cause of strokes. Horners syndrome is seen in strokes affecting the vertebrobasilar system, mainly the lateral medulla.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms suggest a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome. The left MCA supplies the right motor and sensory cortex, which explains the patient's motor and sensory deficits on the right side. The patient's head and eyes deviating towards the left suggests a gaze preference towards the left, which is also consistent with a left MCA syndrome.

###Options:
A.  Elliptocytosis.
B.  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
C.  Pyruvate kinase deficiency.
D.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura.
E.  Sickle cell anemia

###Answer:",D,"Hemolytic anemias are categorized as either intracorpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular disorders, the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) have a shortened lifespan due to an intrinsic factor within the RBC itself. Conversely, extracorpuscular disorders result in a shortened RBC lifespan due to factors external to the RBC.Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acquired disorder characterized by microangiopathy-induced destruction of RBCs and platelets due to destructive shear forces. Symptoms may include fever, mental status changes, and renal impairment. Most acquired adult cases of TTP involve autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS-13. Evaluation for schistocytes in a peripheral smear is crucial for ruling out TTP, as plasmapheresis is lifesaving.Other causes of extravascular hemolytic anemia encompass hypersplenism, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.The remaining disorders listed entail defects within the RBC itself leading to hemolysis:- Elliptocytosis: a membranopathy resulting in varying degrees of RBC destruction within the reticuloendothelial system.- Sickle cell anemia: a congenital hemoglobinopathy characterized by recurrent pain crises and long-term sequelae, stemming from a well-defined ²-globin mutation.- Pyruvate kinase deficiency: a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway causing hemolytic anemia.- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): an acquired hemolysis due to an intrinsic abnormality of RBCs, often accompanied by thrombosis and cytopenias, with bone marrow failure as a serious complication.",Elliptocytosis.,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,Pyruvate kinase deficiency.,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura.,Sickle cell anemia,D,"D

Rationale: 
Extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia refers to hemolytic anemia caused by factors outside the RBC itself. In this case, Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is an example of extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia. It is caused by the formation of thrombi in small blood vessels, which leads to the destruction of RBCs as they pass through these vessels.

On the other hand, elliptocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and sickle cell anemia are all examples of intracorpuscular hemolytic anemias, meaning that the defect lies within the RBC itself. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hemolytic anemia caused by an acquired mutation in the PIGA gene, which leads to the production of abnormal RBCs that are more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. While the defect is not strictly within the RBC membrane, it is still considered an intracorpuscular defect.",True,model6

Rationale: 
Spontaneous abortion of a recognized first-trimester gestation is most commonly due to chromosomal anomalies in 50-60% of gestations. This is because many chromosomal abnormalities are incompatible with life and result in spontaneous abortion. The most common chromosomal anomaly is aneuploidy, which is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes. Other causes of spontaneous abortion include maternal factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease, as well as cervical insufficiency and fetal anomalies.

Breast cancer can metastasize hematogenously (through the bloodstream). This is a correct route of spread.
C. Lymphatic permeating and embolization

Breast cancer commonly spreads via the lymphatic system. This is a correct route of spread.
D. CSF

Breast cancer rarely spreads through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, D is the correct answer.

Rationale: The spread of breast cancer can occur through different routes. The main routes of spread are:

* Local spread: Direct invasion of surrounding tissues, such as the skin, chest wall, and axillary fascia.
* Lymphatic spread: Cancer cells can enter the lymphatic vessels and spread to regional lymph nodes, such as the axillary, internal mammary, and supraclavicular nodes.
* Hematogenous spread: Cancer cells can enter the bloodstream and spread to distant organs, such as the bones, liver, lungs, and brain.
* Transcoelomic spread: Cancer cells can spread through the peritoneal cavity to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other abdominal organs.

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is B. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a blistering rash present on the elbows and buttocks. It is now considered specific for coeliac disease. Abdominal pain and vomiting are each unusual in malabsorption, whereas steatorrhoea is non-specific and does not infer one particular cause over any other.",Abdominal pain,A characteristic rash,Vomiting,Steatorrhoea,,D,"D

Rationale: Coeliac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients. The symptoms of coeliac disease are often nonspecific, but it may be suspected in patients who present with malabsorption, particularly steatorrhoea (fatty stools). Steatorrhoea is a characteristic feature of coeliac disease, as the damaged villi in the small intestine lead to impaired absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Abdominal pain (A) is a nonspecific symptom that can occur in many conditions, including coeliac disease, but it is not a specific indicator of the disease. A characteristic rash (B) is more commonly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin condition that is often associated with coeliac disease, but it is not a primary indicator of coeliac disease.

Rationale: Nifurtimox is an antiparasitic medication that is used to treat Chagas disease. It is effective against both the acute and chronic stages of the disease. It works by generating free radicals that are toxic to the parasite. Suramin is used to treat African trypanosomiasis, not Chagas disease.

C.  Increased secretion of oxytocin from the paraventricular nuclei
D.  Decreased secretion of neurophysin
E.  Increased plasma levels of both oxytocin and ADH

###Answer:",C,"During suckling, stimulation of receptors on the nipples increases neural input to both the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Activation of these nuclei leads to the release of oxytocin and neurophysin from secretion granules in the posterior pituitary gland. Suckling does not stimulate the secretion of appreciable amounts of ADH.",Increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the supraoptic nuclei,Increased secretion of ADH from the paraventricular nuclei,Increased secretion of oxytocin from the paraventricular nuclei,Decreased secretion of neurophysin,Increased plasma levels of both oxytocin and ADH,C,"C

Rationale: During suckling, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is stimulated, leading to the release of oxytocin from the paraventricular nuclei. Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli in the breast, causing milk letdown or milk ejection. This is a normal physiological response to breast-feeding. Option A is incorrect because ADH (also known as vasopressin) is released from the supraoptic nuclei in response to changes in osmotic pressure, not suckling. Option B is incorrect because ADH is released from the supraoptic nuclei, not the paraventricular nuclei. Option D is incorrect because neurophysin is a protein that binds to oxytocin and vasopressin, and its levels would not decrease in response to suckling. Option E is incorrect because only oxytocin, not ADH, is released in response to suckling.",True,model6

He was discharged from the hospital 1 week ago after being treated for a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. He started treatment with ciprofloxacin and rifampin at that time. He also has hypertension and underwent placement of a mechanical aortic valve 6 years ago for aortic stenosis. Other current medications are hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and warfarin. His warfarin dose was doubled 4 days ago. He says that he is trying to follow a healthier diet. He drinks two 12-oz beers daily. Results of laboratory studies done 4 days ago and today are shown4 Days Ago TodayProthrombin time 11 sec (INR=1) 11.2 sec (INR=1.1)Partial thromboplastin time 29 sec 27 secWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's laboratory findings?
###Options:
A.  Decreased protein binding
B.  Eradication of gut flora
C.  Increased alcohol intake
D.  Increased vegetable consumption
E.  Induction of cytochrome enzymes

###Answer:",E,"(E) Induction of cytochrome enzymes could potentially increase the metabolism of warfarin, leading to a decrease in its anticoagulant effect. However, this would typically result in a decrease in the patient's INR, rather than the slight increase observed. Therefore, increased alcohol intake, which can potentiate the effects of warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding, is a more likely cause of the patient's laboratory findings.",Decreased protein binding,Eradication of gut flora,Increased alcohol intake,Increased vegetable consumption,Induction of cytochrome enzymes,B,"B. Eradication of gut flora

Rationale: Rifampin, an antibiotic used to treat nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 system. It can increase the metabolism of warfarin, leading to a decrease in its anticoagulant effect. However, this effect would take longer than 4 days to manifest. The patient's INR was decreased, indicating that the warfarin dose was too low. The most likely explanation is that rifampin eradicated the gut flora that produces vitamin K, which is necessary for the production of clotting factors. This would lead to an increased sensitivity to warfarin, necessitating a decrease in the dose. The patient's beer consumption is unlikely to have a significant effect on the INR. The patient's diet has not changed significantly, and increased vegetable consumption would not affect warfarin levels. Protein binding and partial thromboplastin time are not relevant to this scenario.",False,model6

###Answer:",A,"Depression is typically associated with reduced functioning of the left frontal area of the brain. This is supported by research that indicates decreased activity in the left frontal cortex in individuals with depression. The left frontal area of the brain is involved in regulating emotions and mood, so reduced functioning in this region can contribute to the symptoms of depression","Reduced, left frontal","Reduced, right frontal","Increased, left frontal","Increased, right frontal",None of the above,A,"A

Rationale: Depression is typically associated with reduced functioning of the left frontal area of the brain. This is because the left frontal cortex is involved in executive function, motivation, and reward processing, all of which are impaired in depression. Functional imaging studies have consistently shown reduced activity in the left prefrontal cortex in individuals with depression.",True,model6

He has no significant past medical history. His blood pressure is 190/110 mm Hg, laboratory testing shows raised plasma and urine catecholamines, and abdominal computed tomography is notable for a 3 cm left adrenal mass. The cells responsible for this patient's condition are located in which aspect of the adrenal gland?
###Options:
A.  Zona fasciculata
B.  Zona reticularis
C.  Medulla
D.  Zona glomerulosa
E.  Fasciculata

###Answer:",C,"The adrenal gland, also called the suprarenal gland, is a significant part of the endocrine system. It is composed of 2 distinct tissues: the outer layer or cortex and the inner layer or medulla. The adrenal cortex is composed of 3 distinct zones: zona glomerulosa (outer layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer), and zona reticularis (inner zone).

The adrenal medulla is made up of specialized cells known as chromaffin cells, which aggregate in small clusters around blood vessels. The chromaffin cells in the medulla synthesize epinephrine and norepinephrine. These sympathetic hormones have many physiological activities, including playing a role in the ""fight or flight"" response, increasing heart rate, the force of contraction of the heart, metabolic rate, and cognitive awareness.

Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that arises from chromaffin cells present in the adrenal medulla. It can present with vague symptoms like a headache (50%), palpitations (60%), and diaphoresis (50%) that can lead to a paroxysmal hypertensive crisis due to increased catecholamine production.

The gold standard treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical resection.",Zona fasciculata,Zona reticularis,Medulla,Zona glomerulosa,Fasciculata,C,"C

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla is responsible for producing catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are released in response to stress and can cause the symptoms described. The adrenal cortex, which is divided into the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis, produces steroids, not catecholamines.",True,model6

Since current treatment is mainly supportive, a prime focus should be given on achieving more independence and quality of life.

Long term management, in most cases, is primarily limited to improvement of symptoms and preventing future complications. Patients need to be educated on how to adapt to their new bodies and condition. Impairments after discharge must be addressed, and this includes limitations in mobility and activities of daily living, bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction.

###Answer:",D,The patient's history of consanguineous marriage puts her at a higher risk of developing autosomal recessive disorders such as neurofibromatosis.,Brain tumor,Migraine,Tuberculosis,Neurofibromatosis,Multiple sclerosis,A,"A. Brain tumor

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of chronic headaches and blurred vision are indicative of increased intracranial pressure. The history of consanguineous marriage suggests a genetic component, which is consistent with familial brain tumors such as gliomas or meningiomas. While migraine and multiple sclerosis can also cause headaches and vision disturbances, they are less likely to be associated with consanguineous marriage. Tuberculosis is not typically associated with headaches and blurred vision, and neurofibromatosis is more commonly associated with skin lesions and peripheral nerve tumors.",False,model6

His past medical history is significant for a celiac disease diagnosed at age 24. He has no other significant past medical history. He also complains of numbness and tingling in his feet bilaterally. His physician orders a complete blood count (CBC), which reveals a decrease in hemoglobin of 7.5 mg/dL and hematocrit of 22%. The patient is suspected of a vitamin deficiency, which is confirmed by a peripheral blood smear that shows hypersegmented neutrophils, with a portion of the neutrophils having greater than or equal to 5 lobes. What type of anemia does this patient most likely have?
###Options:
A.  Macrocytic and hyperchromic
B.  Macrocytic and microchromic
C.  Macrocytic and normochromic
D.  Normocytic and macrochromic
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"This patient likely has a vitamin B12 deficiency due to chronic inflammation in the terminal ileum due to his history of celiac disease.

Vitamin B12 binds to a glycoprotein known as intrinsic factor, which is produced by parietal cells in the stomach. The complex is subsequently absorbed in the terminal ileum.

Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for the synthesis of myelin and can lead to a condition known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord when deficient. As a result, patients may present with neurological findings, such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.

Vitamin B12 plays an essential role in the synthesis of DNA, and deficiency can lead to macrocytic anemia. A complete blood count (CBC) would reveal a decrease in hemoglobin, a decrease in hematocrit, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A peripheral blood smear would show large red blood cells with hypersegmented neutrophils. The anemia is macrocytic and normochromic unless there is also iron deficiency.",Macrocytic and hyperchromic,Macrocytic and microchromic,Macrocytic and normochromic,Normocytic and macrochromic,none,C,"C.

Acute mastitis is a clinical diagnosis, and no additional diagnostic testing is needed if the diagnosis is clear and there is no suspicion of an underlying abscess. Breast milk cultures may be helpful to guide antimicrobial selection, especially in the setting of hospital-acquired disease or if the initial empiric treatment is ineffective.

The most common organism causing mastitis is Staphylococcus aureus, and antibiotics should target this organism. If the patient has no risk factors for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), dicloxacillin or cephalexin are the treatments of choice.

Rationale: The patient is likely experiencing a breast abscess or mastitis, which is a common complication of breastfeeding. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with mastitis, which is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic that is effective against S aureus and is the treatment of choice for mastitis. It is also safe for breastfeeding mothers. Ultrasound may be necessary if the patient does not respond to antibiotics or if a breast abscess is suspected, but it is not the first step in management. Metronidazole is not effective against S aureus. Vancomycin may be necessary if the patient has a methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infection, but it is not the first-line treatment.

###Answer:",A,"First-line treatment for the management of intermittent claudication (IC) is the implementation of a supervised exercise program. This should consist of 4 to 5 workouts per week lasting roughly 30 to 45 minutes.

Smoking cessation is imperative in reducing cardiovascular non-fatal and fatal outcomes as well as prevention of disease progression.

There is significant evidence for using graded exercise programs for the improvement of pain-free walking distance and total walking distance.

Cilostazol can be added to symptomatic treatment if patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate exercise programs.",Smoking cessation and enrolment in a supervised exercise program,Computed tomography angiography of the lower extremities,Additional of cilostazol,Referral to vascular surgeon,doppler USS,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in the legs to the blood pressure in the arms. An ABI ratio of <0.9 is diagnostic of PAD. Smoking cessation is a crucial step in the management of PAD, as it can slow disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risk. Supervised exercise programs have been shown to improve symptoms and functional capacity in patients with PAD. This should be the next step in management for this patient. While cilostazol may be added later to improve symptoms, it is not the next best step.

###Options:
A.  MRCP
B.  Endoscopic Ultrasound
C.  Secretin Stimulation Test
D.  Lipase
E.  none of the above

###Answer:",C,"The Secretin Stimulation Test is the best diagnostic test for chronic pancreatitis because it has high sensitivity and specificity. This test involves injecting secretin, a hormone that stimulates the pancreas, and measuring the pancreatic secretions. In chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas does not respond properly to secretin, leading to abnormal secretions. This test can accurately diagnose chronic pancreatitis by detecting these abnormalities. MRCP and Endoscopic Ultrasound can also be used to visualize the pancreas, but they are not as specific for chronic pancreatitis. Lipase is an enzyme that can be elevated in pancreatitis, but it is not specific to chronic pancreatitis and can be elevated in other conditions as well.",MRCP,Endoscopic Ultrasound,Secretin Stimulation Test,Lipase,none of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is considered the most sensitive and specific test for chronic pancreatitis. It can detect early changes in the pancreatic parenchyma and ductal system, including calcifications, fibrosis, and ductal irregularities. EUS has a sensitivity of 80-90% and a specificity of 90-95% for chronic pancreatitis. It is also useful for evaluating pancreatic masses and guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy. MRCP is also a useful test, but it has a lower sensitivity and specificity compared to EUS. Secretin stimulation test is a functional test that measures pancreatic exocrine function, but it is not as sensitive or specific as EUS. Lipase is an enzyme that is elevated in acute pancreatitis, but it is not a diagnostic test for chronic pancreatitis.",False,model6

",Basic structures of all major body organs are completed during this time,Placental circulation is established during this time,Refinement of organ function occurs during this time,Teratogen exposure is highest at this time,None of the above,A,"A

Rationale: The embryonic period, which spans from the third to the eighth week of gestation, is a critical time for organogenesis, during which the basic structures of all major body organs are formed. This is a high-risk time for the development of major birth defects because any disruptions or insults during this period can have a significant impact on the formation of these critical structures.

A.  True
B.  False

###Answer:",B,"Thiazide diuretics are considered effective first-line agents for hypertension management in Black individuals, with studies showing similar or even superior efficacy compared to other drug classes, especially in combination therapy.",True,False,,,,A,"A. True

Rationale: Thiazide diuretics are less effective in lowering blood pressure in Black individuals compared to other racial groups because they tend to have lower renin levels, which makes them less responsive to diuretics. Thiazides work by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule, which leads to increased sodium excretion and decreased blood volume. In Black individuals, the blood pressure response to thiazides is blunted due to their lower renin levels, making them less effective in this population.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Insulin
B.  Thyroid stimulating hormone
C.  Parathyroid hormone
D.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone

###Answer:",C,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. PTH acts to increase calcium levels in the blood by stimulating calcium release from bones, enhancing calcium absorption in the intestines, and promoting calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. Imbalances in PTH levels can lead to disorders such as hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism, affecting calcium metabolism and bone health.",Insulin,Thyroid stimulating hormone,Parathyroid hormone,Adrenocorticotropic hormone,,C,"C. Parathyroid hormone

Rationale: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands and plays a crucial role in regulating calcium levels in the blood. It does this by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, increasing calcium absorption from the gut, and reducing calcium excretion in the urine. PTH is the primary hormone responsible for maintaining normal calcium levels, and abnormalities in PTH production can lead to disorders such as hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism. Insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone are not directly involved in calcium regulation.",True,model6

C.  Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations
D.  Failure of primary esophageal peristalsis
E.  Failure of saliva production

###Answer:",C,"Based on the description and the endoscopic findings of the distal esophagus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:(C) Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxationsThe photograph likely shows signs of esophageal reflux, such as inflammation, erosions, or ulcerations in the distal esophagus, consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations are a major mechanism of GERD, allowing gastric contents to reflux into the esophagus, leading to heartburn and other symptoms.",Defect in secretin production,Excessive gastrin production,Excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations,Failure of primary esophageal peristalsis,Failure of saliva production,C,"C

Rationale: The image shows a peptic stricture, which is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is caused by excessive transient lower esophageal relaxations (TLESRs), which allow stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms. The symptoms are exacerbated by eating late at night or consuming spicy food, as they can delay gastric emptying and increase acid production. The patient's symptoms are temporarily relieved by antacids, which neutralize stomach acid.",True,model6

Rationale: 
The patient is presenting with bleeding and passage of tissues per vaginum, which indicates that some products of conception have already been expelled. She also has lower abdominal pain, which is consistent with uterine contractions. The combination of these symptoms suggests that the pregnancy is no longer viable and the process of abortion is underway, making inevitable abortion the most likely diagnosis.",False,model6

The patient describes the pain as dull, 6/10 in intensity, and occurring a few hours after a meal. His medical history includes alcohol use disorder and a 10-pack-year smoking history. A trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alleviates the patient's pain. What change in pepsin levels in the stomach will occur 2 weeks later?
###Options:
A.  Pepsin increases due to increased H ions within the stomach.
B.  Pepsin increases due to increased pH within the stomach.
C.  Pepsin decreases due to increased pH within the stomach.
D.  Pepsin decreases due to increased H ions within the stomach.
E.  alkalosis

###Answer:",C,"Pepsin is a stomach enzyme that serves to digest proteins found in ingested food.

Pepsinogen, secreted by the chief cells of the gastric mucosa, becomes activated and forms pepsin by the addition of hydrogen ions.

Hydrogen ions are secreted into the gastric juice by proton pumps in the parietal cells.

Proton pump inhibitors are acid-suppressing agents that work by directly inhibiting acid release. Examples of PPIs include omeprazole and esomeprazole. Following PPI administration, hydrogen ion secretion is expected to decrease, leading to increased pH. High pH levels in the stomach decrease pepsinogen activation, and pepsin levels decline.",Pepsin increases due to increased H ions within the stomach.,Pepsin increases due to increased pH within the stomach.,Pepsin decreases due to increased pH within the stomach.,Pepsin decreases due to increased H ions within the stomach.,alkalosis,C,"C

Rationale: Pepsin is an enzyme produced by chief cells in the stomach that breaks down proteins into peptides and amino acids. It is most active at a pH of 1.5-2.5. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, leading to an increase in pH. As a result, pepsin levels decrease due to the less acidic environment.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, particularly the headache and fever, suggest the possibility of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis). The increased pain when brushing her hair is also consistent with this diagnosis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific test that is often elevated in temporal arteritis, and it is a good initial investigation to help support or rule out this diagnosis.

C.  Increase in hormone activity
D.  Increase in degree of negative feedback exerted by the hormone
E.  Increase in plasma reservoir for rapid replenishment of free hormone

###Answer:",E,"Protein-bound hormones are biologically inactive and cannot be metabolized. Thus, an increase in protein binding would tend to decrease hormone activity and plasma clearance and increase the halflife of the hormone. Free hormone is also responsible for negative feedback inhibition of hormone secretion. Therefore, a sudden increase in hormone binding to plasma proteins would decrease negative feedback. Protein binding of hormones does, however,  provide a reservoir for the rapid replacement of free hormone.",Increase in plasma clearance of the hormone,Decrease in half-life of the hormone,Increase in hormone activity,Increase in degree of negative feedback exerted by the hormone,Increase in plasma reservoir for rapid replenishment of free hormone,E,"E.  Increase in plasma reservoir for rapid replenishment of free hormone

Rationale: When a hormone binds to plasma proteins, it becomes less available for interaction with its receptors. This binding reduces the free hormone concentration, which in turn reduces its activity. However, the bound hormone acts as a reservoir that can rapidly replenish the free hormone pool as needed. This means that the bound hormone is not eliminated or degraded but remains available for use. Therefore, increased binding of a hormone to plasma proteins would increase the plasma reservoir for rapid replenishment of free hormone.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"This is a young patient with a clotting disorder related to reduced platelets. She is clinically well, therefore meningococcal septicaemia is unlikely. HSP usually presents with a symmetrical, usually macular rash, often on the buttocks or back of legs, in addition to joint or abdominal pain. None of these fits this clinical history, making HSP less likely. Von Willebrands factor is normal. It would be important to consider non accidental injury, however platelets are reduced in this case, leaving ITP as the most likely diagnosis. Therefore the answer is C.",Meningococcal septicaemia,Henoch-Schonlein purpura,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Von Willebrands disease,Non Accidental Injury,C,"C.

Rationale: The patient has petechiae on her knees and shins, and frequent nosebleeds, which are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The normal PT, APTT, vW factor, factor VIII, and factor IX rule out coagulation disorders. The patient's platelet count is low, which suggests thrombocytopenia. The patient's history of a viral infection 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms, and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of illness, suggest that the thrombocytopenia is immune-mediated, which is consistent with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is a common cause of thrombocytopenia in children, and it often follows a viral infection.

###Answer:",A,"In transposition of the great artery, the right atrium still receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it into the right ventricle, which then pumps it into the aorta instead of the pulmonary artery.",True,False,,,,A,"A

Rationale: In transposition of the great arteries, the right atrium is connected to the right ventricle, and the left atrium is connected to the left ventricle. The anomaly lies in the transposition of the aorta and pulmonary artery, which arises from the opposite ventricles, i.e., the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This leads to deoxygenated blood being pumped to the systemic circulation and oxygenated blood being pumped to the pulmonary circulation.",True,model6

This has been happening for a year. The patient admits that her father had a history of similar symptoms. Which of the following is consistent with this disease process in relation to a gastrinoma?
###Options:
A.  Gastrinoma with a prolactinoma
B.  Gastrinoma and diarrhea
C.  Gastrinoma and hypocalcemia
D.  Gastrinoma with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels
E.  Gastrinoma and constipation

###Answer:",A,"In patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1), an autosomal-dominant disorder, there is a clustering of the pituitary, parathyroid, and pancreatic tumors. Patients diagnosed with gastrinoma must be evaluated for MEN1 symptoms by asking about family history, symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis), or symptoms of pituitary tumors (most commonly a prolactinoma which causes galactorrhea in females while headache and bitemporal hemianopia in males). Labs must be performed to measure serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and prolactin.

70% to 75% of gastrinomas are sporadic; however, 25% to 30% of these tumors are associated with type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1). Surgery is not recommended in MEN1 associated gastrinomas less than 2 cm in diameter as surgery is rarely curative in the presence of MEN1.

MEN1 may also present with symptoms of insulinoma (symptoms of hypoglycemia), glucagonoma (necrotizing migratory erythema (NME), diabetes, weight loss, and anemia), or VIPoma (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypochlorhydria).

Diarrhea is a feature of a gastrinoma and does not suggest MEN1. MEN1 is usually associated with hyperparathyroidism due to the parathyroid glands being affected, which would also cause elevated calcium levels.",Gastrinoma with a prolactinoma,Gastrinoma and diarrhea,Gastrinoma and hypocalcemia,Gastrinoma with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels,Gastrinoma and constipation,B,"B

Rationale: The symptoms presented in this patient are consistent with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is a rare condition caused by a gastrinoma, a type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The excess gastrin produced by the tumor leads to increased acid production in the stomach, resulting in peptic ulcers that are refractory to antacids. The diarrhea is due to the increased acid production and the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes. The galactorrhea is likely due to a prolactinoma, which is a common association with gastrinoma in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The patient's family history is also consistent with MEN1, which is an autosomal dominant disorder. The kidney stones are likely due to the hypercalcemia that is often seen in MEN1 due to a parathyroid adenoma. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",False,model6

A.  Sodium bicarbonate  {NaHCO3}
B.  Calcium carbonate {CaCO3}
C.  Aluminum hydroxide {Al(OH)3}
D.  Magnesium hydroxide {Mg(OH)2}
E.  Calcium hydroxide {Ca(OH)2}

###Answer:",A,"All antacids have the potential to induce metabolic alkalosis by sparing endogenous bicarbonate, which is normally secreted in the stomach under the control of prostaglandin E2. Furthermore, exogenous bicarbonate from antacids is easily and fully absorbed, heightening the risk of metabolic alkalosis compared to calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts, which have an oral bioavailability of less than 30%.",Sodium bicarbonate  {NaHCO3},Calcium carbonate {CaCO3},Aluminum hydroxide {Al(OH)3},Magnesium hydroxide {Mg(OH)2},Calcium hydroxide {Ca(OH)2},A,"A

Rationale: 
The correct answer is A. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). 

Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic antacid, which means it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause metabolic alkalosis. It contains bicarbonate ions, which can increase the pH of the blood and lead to metabolic alkalosis. 

The other options are non-systemic antacids, which are not absorbed into the bloodstream and therefore do not pose a risk of metabolic alkalosis. Calcium carbonate (B) and magnesium hydroxide (D) are both non-systemic antacids that work locally in the stomach to neutralize acid. Aluminum hydroxide (C) is also a non-systemic antacid, but it can cause constipation as a side effect. Calcium hydroxide (E) is not a commonly used antacid.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Serum methylmalonate
B.  Red blood cell folate
C.  Serum cobalamin
D.  Serum pepsinogen
E.  Serum homocysteine

###Answer:",C,"Serum cobalamin levels, typically measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serve as a cost-effective means to rule out deficiency, with normal levels above 200 ng/L. In cases of megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency, levels usually fall below 100 ng/L, correlating with the severity of deficiency. Notably, even in the absence of anemia, individuals with spinal cord damage from cobalamin deficiency exhibit very low serum levels. Borderline low levels may be observed in pregnancy with megaloblastic anemia stemming from folate deficiency. Elevated serum methylmalonate (MMA) levels indicate cobalamin deficiency-induced anemia or neuropathy, while elevated homocysteine levels suggest early cobalamin or folate deficiency, though they may also occur in various other conditions. Red blood cell folate assays offer insights into body folate stores, less influenced by recent diet or hemolysis compared to serum assays. Subnormal levels may indicate folate deficiency anemia or severe cobalamin deficiency. False-normal results can arise post-blood transfusion or with increased reticulocyte count. Low serum pepsinogen levels may indicate pernicious anemia.",Serum methylmalonate,Red blood cell folate,Serum cobalamin,Serum pepsinogen,Serum homocysteine,C,"C

Rationale: 
Serum cobalamin is the most cost-effective means to assess a patient suspected of having cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can be diagnosed by measuring serum cobalamin levels. A level < 100 pg/mL is considered deficient, 100-200 pg/mL is considered borderline, and > 200 pg/mL is considered normal. This test is widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to other options. While methylmalonate and homocysteine levels can also be elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency, these tests are more expensive and not as widely available. Red blood cell folate is not a specific test for vitamin B12 deficiency. Serum pepsinogen is not a test for vitamin B12 deficiency.",True,model6

###Answer:",A,"Rh incompatibility develops when an Rh-negative female individual conceives an Rh-positive fetus. Therefore, this Rh-positive patient should not develop Rh hemolytic disease, and reassurance is appropriate.

If the mother is Rh positive, the probability of developing Rh-hemolytic disease would be minimal, especially in the first pregnancy.

ABO incompatibility develops when a woman with blood group O conceives a fetus with an A or B blood group. Therefore, this patient with A-positive blood should not develop an ABO compatibility because her partner has O-negative blood.

Reassure the patient that Rh hemolytic disease is extremely unlikely.

Rationale: The patient is A positive, which means she is Rh positive, and her husband is O negative. Therefore, there is no risk of Rh hemolytic disease. Rh hemolytic disease occurs when an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood during pregnancy, leading to the production of antibodies against the Rh antigen. These antibodies can then cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in a subsequent Rh-positive fetus. The patient's history of irregular menstrual cycles and the ultrasound findings suggest that she is approximately 30 weeks of gestation. Therefore, there is no need for Rho(D) immune globulin administration, which is typically given at 28 weeks of gestation to prevent sensitization in Rh-negative women. The Rosette test is used to detect the presence of antibodies against the Rh antigen, but it is not necessary in this scenario. There is no need for antenatal fetal surveillance due to ABO incompatibility, as ABO incompatibility is typically associated with mild hemolytic disease and is not a significant concern in this case.",True,model6

Explanation:

The clinical presentation of a 34-year-old long-distance driver with a 3-day history of the inability to use the right side of the body, HIV positive with oral thrush, and deep hemiplegia on the right side of the body suggests a diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis.

Left ventricular wall thickness

Rationale: The patient has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) based on the physical examination and echocardiogram findings. The patient is at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to several factors. 

1. **Family history**: The patient's sister died suddenly at a young age, which suggests a possible genetic component to the patient's condition.

2. **History of syncope**: The patient has experienced syncope, which is a risk factor for SCD.

3. **Documented episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on a Holter monitor**: This would be an additional risk factor for SCD, but it is not mentioned in the question stem.

4. **A decrease in blood pressure during exercise**: This would also be a risk factor for SCD.

However, **left ventricular wall thickness** is not a risk factor for SCD in HCM. In fact, a thicker left ventricular wall may be protective against SCD.

The patient's lack of recollection of the events that transpired also supports this diagnosis, as VT can cause a loss of consciousness. Neurocardiogenic syncope (A) is less likely, as it typically occurs in response to a specific stimulus, such as dehydration or pain. Third-degree AV block (B) can also cause syncope, but it is less likely to occur in an individual with a history of myocardial infarction. A seizure (D) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a cardiac arrhythmia.",True,model6

His past medical history is significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease status-post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 5 years ago, and obstructive sleep apnea. On examination, he appears drowsy but is easily rousable. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. Physical examination reveals prominent jugular venous pulsations, bilateral basal inspiratory crackles, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. His extremities are cold to touch. No focal deficits are noted. A computed tomogram (CT) of the brain is unremarkable. Vitals reveal a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 70/52 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry of 88% on room air. A chest x-ray reveals signs of bilateral pulmonary congestion. The patient is started on norepinephrine and transferred to the intensive care unit for further management. Which of the following findings is most likely to be appreciated on right heart catheterization in this patient?

###Answer:",C,"This patient is in cardiogenic shock since he is hypotensive and has signs of volume overload in the setting of congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction.

A cardiogenic shock is characterized by hypotension, depressed cardiac function (low cardiac output/cardiac index), and volume overload with signs of hypoperfusion.

A right heart catheterization will reveal an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure due to left ventricular dysfunction. Elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (over 15 mmHg) is a marker of elevated left-sided filling pressures due to significant volume overload.

This patient will also have elevated left atrial and right atrial pressures due to decreased forward flow (cardiac output).",Low right atrial pressure,Low left atrial pressure,High pulmonary capillary wedge pressure,Low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure,ventricular failure,C,"C. High pulmonary capillary wedge pressure

Rationale: 
The patient in this scenario is likely suffering from cardiogenic shock secondary to decompensated heart failure. The physical examination findings of prominent jugular venous pulsations, bilateral basal inspiratory crackles, and bilateral pitting pedal edema support this diagnosis. The patient's vital signs, including a low blood pressure and tachycardia, also support this diagnosis. Right heart catheterization would likely reveal a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating elevated left-sided filling pressures. This is consistent with cardiogenic shock secondary to left ventricular failure. Options A and D are incorrect because the patient's physical examination findings suggest elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures, respectively. Option B is incorrect because the patient's chest x-ray reveals signs of bilateral pulmonary congestion, indicating elevated left atrial pressure. Option E is a diagnosis, not a finding on right heart catheterization.",True,model6

###Answer:",E,"the most likely diagnosis for the 67-year-old man is unstable angina. Unstable angina is characterized by chest pain that is typically described as a heaviness or pressure, and it can radiate to the jaw. The presence of significant ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF on the ECG suggests myocardial ischemia. It's important for the patient to receive further evaluation and appropriate treatment to address the underlying cause of his symptoms.",Hypokalaemia,Anterior NSTEMI from thrombus in left anterior descending coronary artery,Anterior NSTEMI from right thrombus coronary artery,Anterior NATEMI in left circumflex artery,Anterolateral STEMI FROM occulusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery,D,"D.  Anterior NATEMI in left circumflex artery

Rationale: The patient presents with central chest pain radiating to the jaw, which is a classic symptom of acute coronary syndrome. The ECG shows significant ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF, which is indicative of an inferior non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The leads II, III, and aVF correspond to the inferior wall of the heart, which is supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex artery (LCx). Given that the patient's ECG shows ST depression in these leads, it suggests that the infarction is likely to be in the LCx territory, as the RCA would typically produce ST elevation in these leads. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an anterior NSTEMI in the left circumflex artery.",False,model6

Rationale: During pregnancy, many pulmonary volumes and capacities change from the non-pregnant state. However, vital capacity (VC) remains relatively unchanged. Vital capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled from the lungs after taking a maximal inspiration. Although residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC) decrease during pregnancy, VC remains the same due to the compensatory increase in tidal volume.

###Options:
A.  It continues to derive nutrition from endometrial secretions
B.  The cells of the blastocyst contain stored nutrients that are metabolized for nutritional support
C.  The placenta provides nutrition derived from maternal blood
D.  The trophoblast cells digest the nutrient-rich endometrial cells and then absorb their contents for use by the blastocyst
E.  None

###Answer:",D,"As the blastocyst implants, the trophoblast cells invade the decidua, digesting and imbibing it. The stored nutrients in the decidual cells are used by the embryo for growth and development. During the 1st week after implantation, this is the only means by which the embryo can obtain nutrients. The embryo continues to obtain at least some of its nutrition in this way for up to 8 weeks, although the placenta begins to provide nutrition after about the 16th day beyond fertilization (a little more than 1 week after implantation).",It continues to derive nutrition from endometrial secretions,The cells of the blastocyst contain stored nutrients that are metabolized for nutritional support,The placenta provides nutrition derived from maternal blood,The trophoblast cells digest the nutrient-rich endometrial cells and then absorb their contents for use by the blastocyst,,D,"D. The trophoblast cells digest the nutrient-rich endometrial cells and then absorb their contents for use by the blastocyst

Rationale: After implantation, the blastocyst continues to grow and develop. During this time, the trophoblast cells, which are the outer layer of cells of the blastocyst, play a crucial role in providing nutrition to the embryo. They do this by digesting the nutrient-rich endometrial cells and then absorbing their contents for use by the blastocyst. This process is known as histotrophism. The trophoblast cells continue to provide nutrition to the embryo until the placenta is fully functional, which occurs around the 12th day of embryonic development.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Cortisol
B.  Adrenalin
C.  Insulin
D.  Thyroxine

###Answer:",A,"Cortisol, also known as the ""stress hormone,"" is produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress and helps regulate metabolism.

Cortisol

Rationale: Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating the body's response to stress, regulating blood sugar levels, and aiding in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. It is often referred to as the ""stress hormone"" because its levels increase in response to stress, whether physical or emotional.

Rationale: 
Terbinafine is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat fungal infections of the nails, skin, and hair. It is highly effective against dermatophytes, which are the most common cause of onychomycosis. Terbinafine is available in oral and topical formulations, and is generally well-tolerated. Micafungin is an echinocandin antifungal that is used to treat invasive fungal infections, but is not typically used to treat onychomycosis. Itraconazole is another antifungal that can be used to treat onychomycosis, but it has a higher risk of drug interactions and side effects compared to terbinafine. Griseofulvin is an older antifungal medication that is no longer commonly used due to its limited spectrum of activity and higher risk of side effects.",True,model6

He is receivinghigh-dose methotrexate therapy. A drug is added to the patient's medication regimen to decrease the toxicity of thistherapy to normal cells. The beneficial effect of this new drug on normal cells is most likely achieved by bypassing thecellular requirement for which of the following enzymes?
###Options:
A.  Dihydrofolate reductase
B.  Methionine synthase
C.  Pyruvate decarboxylase
D.  Thiamine pyrophosphate
E.  Thymidylate synthase

###Answer:",A,"The drug added to the patient's medication regimen is likely to bypass the cellular requirement for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).High-dose methotrexate therapy works by inhibiting DHFR, which is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a critical cofactor in the synthesis of nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines. By inhibiting DHFR, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis and cell division, particularly affecting rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells.However, this also affects normal cells, leading to toxicity. Adding a drug that bypasses the cellular requirement for DHFR would reduce toxicity to normal cells by providing an alternative pathway for the synthesis of THF.Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Dihydrofolate reductase.",Dihydrofolate reductase,Methionine synthase,Pyruvate decarboxylase,Thiamine pyrophosphate,Thymidylate synthase,A,"A. Dihydrofolate reductase

Rationale: The patient is receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy, which is a folic acid antagonist that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). To decrease the toxicity of methotrexate to normal cells, leucovorin (folinic acid) is often administered. Leucovorin is a reduced form of folic acid that bypasses the need for DHFR, allowing it to directly enter the folate pathway and provide a source of tetrahydrofolate for normal cells. This allows normal cells to continue to synthesize DNA and other important compounds, while the cancer cells are still inhibited by the methotrexate.",True,model6

Rationale: The symptoms described, including vaginal bleeding, breast development, and pelvic pain, are indicative of a granulosa cell tumor. This type of tumor is a rare, but significant cause of precocious puberty in young girls. The tumor produces estrogen, which stimulates breast development and vaginal bleeding. The pelvic pain is likely due to the tumor itself or related complications. While unexplained precocious puberty (option E) may also present with breast development and vaginal bleeding, it would not typically cause pelvic pain. Normal menarche (option A) would not occur at the age of 8, and DES exposure (option D) is typically associated with vaginal adenosis or clear cell carcinoma, not precocious puberty. A benign teratoma (option B) is a type of ovarian tumor, but it would not typically cause estrogen-related symptoms.",False,model6

Sickle cell-related intrahepatic cholestasis

Rationale: The patient has a history of sickle cell disease and has undergone cholecystectomy, ruling out gallstones as the cause of his symptoms. The presence of fever, impaired liver function, and hyperbilirubinemia suggests an acute hepatic process. Sickle cell-related intrahepatic cholestasis is a rare but known complication of sickle cell disease, characterized by episodes of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and impaired liver function.

Rationale: 
The development of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in a hospitalized patient after surgery is a significant adverse event that can be prevented with proper prophylaxis. In this scenario, the absence of DVT prophylaxis perioperatively contributed to the development of the DVT. The best approach to prevent similar adverse events in the future is to develop an institutional policy with standardized orders for DVT prophylaxis. This policy would ensure that all patients at risk for DVT receive appropriate prophylaxis, such as low-molecular-weight heparin or compression stockings, in a consistent and reliable manner. While conducting a nursing in-service (Option A) or encouraging early ambulation (Option C) may be helpful, they are not as effective as developing a standardized policy.

He states that the pain is worse in the mornings and is relieved after meals. On direct questioning, there is no history of weight loss and the patients bowel habits are normal. On examination, his abdomen is soft and experiences moderate discomfort on palpation of the epigastric region. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Gastric ulcer
B.  Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
C.  Duodenal ulcer
D.  Gastric carcinoma
E.  Gastritis

###Answer:",C,"Although all of the answers may present with abdominal pain, the key to the answer is in the history. Duodenal ulcers (C), which are four times more common than gastric ulcers, classically present with abdominal pain which is usually relieved after meals or drinking milk. Gastric ulcers (A) on the other hand present with abdominal pain which tends to worsen after meals. In either duodenal/gastric ulcers, weight loss may be an associated symptom, but this is usually more common in gastric ulcers. Patients who suffer from GORD (B) usually experience retrosternal discomfort (heartburn) after meals and on lying flat. In addition, abdominal discomfort and pain in patients with gastritis (E) usually occurs after meals. Gastric carcinomas (D) tend to present with abdominal pain and drastic weight loss (e.g. 23 stone weight loss in the space of three months).",Gastric ulcer,Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD),Duodenal ulcer,Gastric carcinoma,Gastritis,C,"C. Duodenal ulcer

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are classic for peptic ulcer disease, specifically duodenal ulcer. The pain is epigastric, dull, and worse in the mornings, which is consistent with the natural acid production of the stomach. The relief of pain after meals is also consistent with duodenal ulcer, as food buffers the acid and provides temporary relief. The lack of weight loss and normal bowel habits make gastric carcinoma less likely. Gastritis may cause similar symptoms, but it is less likely to cause a consistent pattern of morning pain relief with meals. GORD typically causes burning retrosternal pain and is less likely to cause epigastric pain. Gastric ulcer pain is often relieved by antacids and food, but it is less likely to follow a consistent morning pattern.",True,model6

B.  Normal percussion on the right upper lung field
C.  Increased tactile fremitus on the right upper lung field
D.  Bronchial breath sounds on the right upper lung field
E.  Wheezing on the right upper lung field

###Answer:",A,"Decreased or absent breath sounds indicate that air is not reaching the area of the lung being examined, which is consistent with an obstructive process like a tumor. In this case, the lung mass observed in the X-ray is likely causing obstruction leading to decreased breath sounds on the right upper lung field.",Decreased breath sounds on the upper right lung field,Normal percussion on the right upper lung field,Increased tactile fremitus on the right upper lung field,Bronchial breath sounds on the right upper lung field,Wheezing on the right upper lung field,C,"C. Increased tactile fremitus on the right upper lung field

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of difficulty in breathing and unproductive cough, along with the presence of a mass in the right upper lobe on chest X-ray, suggest an obstructive malignancy. Among the options, increased tactile fremitus on the right upper lung field is the most suggestive of an obstructive malignancy. Tactile fremitus is a palpable vibration felt on the chest wall when the patient speaks or coughs. It is increased in areas of consolidation or compression, such as those caused by a tumor.

Rationale: 
The decrease in LH secretion 7 days after ovulation is due to the negative feedback effect of estrogen and progesterone produced by the corpus luteum on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and LH from the pituitary gland. This negative feedback loop prevents further stimulation of the corpus luteum and prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg.",True,model6

She states that the pain came on after lifting something heavy, and her legs gave way. Subsequently, she has been unable to pass any bowel movements. During the musculoskeletal system examination, her hip movements are severely reduced on the right side, with the pain worsening on the internal rotation of the hip.

###Answer:",A,"This is the Howship-Romberg sign, caused by compression of the obturator nerve. The obturator artery and vein also pass through this canal

The obturator nerve supplies the adductors of the hip. Stretching it causes pain

Left-sided obturator hernias are rare, among the already rare pathology of an obturator hernia, due to the mobile sigmoid colon on that side

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms suggest an obturator hernia. Obturator hernia is a rare type of hernia that occurs when part of the intestine protrudes through the obturator foramen, a small opening in the pelvis. The obturator foramen is a canal that contains the obturator nerve, artery, and vein. The obturator nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus (L2-L4) that supplies the adductor compartment of the thigh. The obturator artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery, and the obturator vein drains into the internal iliac vein. The patient's symptoms, including radiating pain to the groin and difficulty passing bowel movements, are consistent with an obturator hernia. The hip movements being severely reduced on the right side, with the pain worsening on internal rotation of the hip, further support this diagnosis.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Surgery over the next few days
B.  Surgery at 1 year of age
C.  Application of a hernia truss
D.  Reassure and discharge
E.  Surgery once the child is 6 months old

###Answer:",A,"Surgery over the next few daysInguinal hernia is a type of ventral hernia that occurs when an intra-abdominal structure, such as bowel or omentum, protrudes through a defect in the abdominal wall. Inguinal hernias do not spontaneously heal and must be surgically repaired because of the ever-present risk of incarceration. Generally, a surgical consultation should be made at the time of diagnosis, and repair (on an elective basis) should be performed very soon after the diagnosis is confirmed.The infant or child with an inguinal hernia generally presents with an obvious bulge at the internal or external ring or within the scrotum. The parents typically provide the history of a visible swelling or bulge, commonly intermittent, in the inguinoscrotal region in boys and inguinolabial region in girls. The swelling may or may not be associated with any pain or discomfort.",Surgery over the next few days,Surgery at 1 year of age,Application of a hernia truss,Reassure and discharge,Surgery once the child is 6 months old,A,"A. Surgery over the next few days

Rationale: Inguinal hernias in infants are usually indirect inguinal hernias and are caused by a patent processus vaginalis. They are more common in premature infants and are usually asymptomatic. However, they can lead to complications such as incarceration and strangulation, which can be serious. Therefore, surgical repair is usually recommended as soon as possible, usually within a few days or weeks of diagnosis.

He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was started on metoprolol and another drug that reduces cardiovascular mortality and controls blood pressure. What is a possible adverse effect of this second drug?
###Options:
A.  Hypokalemia
B.  Diarrhea
C.  Proteinuria
D.  Cough
E.  fever

###Answer:",D,"The conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I is reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Overall, they reduce the levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone while increasing the levels of renin and bradykinin. Bradykinin which is normally broken down by ACE, increases and causes cough.

Angiotensin II, which is decreased by captopril, is responsible for the vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules.

The only two ACE inhibitors that do not have to be activated in the body to be effective are lisinopril and captopril, while others need to be activated to be effective. Some side effects include paroxysmal cough (1% to 10%), angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

Regarding the cardiovascular system, ACE inhibitors reduce preload by causing vasodilation and natriuresis and reduce afterload by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II. The overall effect is the improvement of cardiac output and reduced blood pressure.",Hypokalemia,Diarrhea,Proteinuria,Cough,fever,D,"D.  Cough

Rationale: The second drug that reduces cardiovascular mortality and controls blood pressure is likely an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a dry, persistent cough in some patients. This is due to the inhibition of bradykinin breakdown, which leads to increased levels of bradykinin and stimulation of the cough reflex. This side effect is seen in up to 20% of patients taking ACE inhibitors.",True,model6

A.  1100 ml
B.  1250 ml
C.  1550 ml
D.  1700 ml

###Answer:",C,"To calculate the maintenance daily fluid requirement for a child, a commonly used formula is the Holliday-Segar method, which recommends 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 mL/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 mL/kg for every kg thereafter.

For a 22-kg infant:

The first 10 kg would require 100 mL/kg * 10 kg = 1000 mL.
The next 10 kg would require 50 mL/kg * 10 kg = 500 mL.
The remaining 2 kg would require 20 mL/kg * 2 kg = 40 mL.
Adding these together: 1000 mL + 500 mL + 40 mL = 1540 mL.

So, the maintenance daily fluid requirement for a 22-kg infant is approximately 1550 mL, which corresponds to option c.

For a 22-kg infant, the fluid requirement would be 1000 mL (100 mL/kg x 10 kg) + 500 mL (50 mL/kg x 10 kg) + 200 mL (20 mL/kg x 2 kg) = 1700 mL. However, this is the total daily fluid requirement, and the maintenance daily fluid requirement is approximately 65% of this, which is 1100 mL.",False,model6

###Answer:",B,"In this question, a newborn female is born with hydrocephalus (enlarged head), intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis (redness of the eyes). This triad suggests congenital toxoplasmosis, which is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.

Primary infection during pregnancy is considered a very high risk for fetal infection. However, pregnant mothers with previous infections do not transmit the disease to their unborn babies.

Risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis include pregnant mothers consuming raw meat and transmission via household cats. This often occurs while changing cat litter. Pregnant women with a household cat should avoid changing the litter box to prevent the spread of Toxoplasma gondii.

Eating unpasteurized dairy products is associated with an increased risk for Listeriosis. Multiple sexual partners increase the risk of developing a herpes simplex virus infection.

Rationale: The newborn female's condition is likely congenital toxoplasmosis, given the findings of an enlarged head and red eyes, along with the CT brain showing generalized intracranial calcifications. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii. The strongest risk factor for developing congenital toxoplasmosis is maternal infection during pregnancy, which can occur through ingestion of undercooked meat, contaminated food and water, or contact with cat feces, as cats are the primary hosts of T. gondii. Cleaning the cat litter box is a specific risk factor, as the parasite can be shed in the feces of infected cats.

Rationale: The primary function of the kidneys in maintaining fluid balance in the body is to reabsorb water. The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating the amount of water in the body by controlling the amount of water reabsorbed back into the bloodstream from the filtrate. This process is regulated by the hormone vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone, or ADH), which is produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. When vasopressin binds to receptors in the kidneys, it increases the permeability of the collecting ducts to water, allowing more water to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.

###Options:
A.  Isoniazid
B.  Rifampicin
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethambutol
E.  Streptomycin

###Answer:",A,"Isoniazid causes peripheral neuritis.The development of peripheral neuropathy during isoniazid therapy is multifactorial, involving a combination of vitamin B6 deficiency, direct neurotoxic effects, metabolic intermediates, and individual genetic susceptibility. Supplementing with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) alongside isoniazid therapy is a common strategy to prevent or alleviate peripheral neuropathy in susceptible individuals.",Isoniazid,Rifampicin,Pyrazinamide,Ethambutol,Streptomycin,A,"A. Isoniazid

Rationale: Isoniazid is known to cause peripheral neuritis as a side effect. This is because it can interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The risk of peripheral neuritis is higher in individuals with pre-existing vitamin B6 deficiency, diabetes, or those taking large doses of isoniazid. The other options are not typically associated with peripheral neuritis.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Ventral induction
B.  Secondary neurolation
C.  Organization
D.  Migration
E.  Myelination

###Answer:",A,"Holoprosencephaly is a developmental disorder characterized by incomplete separation of the forebrain during embryogenesis. Ventral induction refers to the process by which the ventral (bottom) structures of the brain are formed. Therefore, a deviation in ventral induction could lead to abnormalities in the development of the brain, potentially resulting in holoprosencephaly. This suggests that ventral induction is the stage of embryogenesis that is likely affected in individuals with holoprosencephaly.",Ventral induction,Secondary neurolation,Organization,Migration,Myelination,A,"A

Rationale: Holoprosencephaly is a group of rare congenital brain malformations that occur when the prosencephalon (the precursor to the forebrain) fails to properly divide and form the two hemispheres of the brain. This occurs during the ventral induction stage of embryogenesis, which is around the 3rd week of gestation. During this stage, the neural plate is induced to form the neural tube, and the prosencephalon is formed. Any deviation in this process can lead to holoprosencephaly.",True,model6

Rationale: Orthopnoea is a symptom of left-sided heart failure, characterized by shortness of breath when lying down. The immediate short-term goal of treatment is to decrease venous return to the heart, which can be achieved by elevating the head of the bed, using pillows to support the upper body, or having the client sit up in a chair.

During her hospital stay, she develops hypotension and a change in mental status. Her examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distension, and she is diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. What is the next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide
B.  Endotracheal intubation
C.  Cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion
D.  Bi-level positive airway pressure and bedside pericardiocentesis
E.  bed-side pericardiocentesis

###Answer:",A,"Patients with cardiac tamponade present similarly to patients with other forms of cardiogenic or obstructive shock. They may report vague symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or in more severe cases, dizziness, syncope, and altered mental status. They may also present with a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest. The classic physical findings in cardiac tamponade included in the Beck triad are hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds.

Echocardiography is the best imaging modality to use at the bedside, whether it is a point-of-care echo or a cardiology echo study. Echocardiography can confirm a pericardial effusion and can also determine its size and whether it is causing a compromise of cardiac function (right ventricular diastolic collapse, right atrial systolic collapse, or plethoric inferior vena cava).

Before rushing to decompression of the pericardium, the patient should be provided with oxygen, volume expansion, and bed rest with the legs elevated. If possible, positive pressure mechanical ventilation should be avoided as it may further decrease venous return and aggravate the symptoms.

Treatment is pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy. Needle pericardiocentesis at the bedside can be performed either with the traditional landmark technique in a subxiphoid window or using a point-of-care echo to guide needle placement in real-time.","Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide",Endotracheal intubation,Cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion,Bi-level positive airway pressure and bedside pericardiocentesis,bed-side pericardiocentesis,A,"A

Rationale: Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt intervention. The patient's symptoms and signs, including hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension, are consistent with this diagnosis. The next step in management is to stabilize the patient with oxygen supplementation and IV fluid resuscitation, followed by pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide to drain the pericardial fluid and relieve the tamponade. Endotracheal intubation is not necessary at this point, and cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion are not indicated for cardiac tamponade. Bi-level positive airway pressure is not a recommended treatment for cardiac tamponade, and bedside pericardiocentesis alone is not sufficient without proper stabilization and guidance.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Thyroid stimulating hormone level
B.  Chest X-ray
C.  Serial troponins
D.  Serologic test for Lyme disease
E.  ultrasound

###Answer:",A,"The best next test for this patient would be a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, given a lack of fever or respiratory infection symptoms and a history of an autoimmune disease. It would be appropriate to order a TSH level to rule out thyroid disease as a cause of her sinus bradycardia.

It is appropriate to rule out any infectious etiology, such as pneumonia, in patients with a finding of sinus bradycardia. However, this patient denies any fevers, chills, cough, or shortness of breath. A chest x-ray would not be needed at this time.

Serial troponins are needed to rule out acute myocardial infarction as a cause of sinus bradycardia. However, this patient does not present with typical acute coronary syndrome symptoms. If the TSH level is normal, an echocardiogram should be considered.

Lyme disease is a known cause of sinus bradycardia. However, this patient does not give a history of residing in or traveling to an area endemic to Lyme disease. Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and weakness associated with an ECG finding of sinus bradycardia are not an indication for serologic testing for Lyme disease",Thyroid stimulating hormone level,Chest X-ray,Serial troponins,Serologic test for Lyme disease,ultrasound,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weakness along with a bradycardia (heart rate of 50 beats/min) suggest hypothyroidism. The patient's age and medical history also increase the likelihood of hypothyroidism. The best next test to order would be a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level.

D.  Left sided pneumothorax
E.  Left sided lung fibrosis

###Answer:",C,"The sudden onset of chest pain and difficulty breathing, along with findings such as tracheal deviation, hyper-resonant percussion note, and reduced breath sounds on one side of the chest, are consistent with a pneumothorax.The tracheal deviation to the left suggests a tension pneumothorax on the right side, where air accumulates in the pleural space and causes pressure to build up, pushing the trachea away from the affected side.",Right sided lobar pneumonia,Right sided pleural effusion,Right sided pneumothorax,Left sided pneumothorax,Left sided lung fibrosis,C,"C. Right sided pneumothorax

Rationale: The patient is presenting with sudden onset chest pain and difficulty breathing, which are common symptoms of a pneumothorax. The tracheal deviation to the left suggests that the right lung is not expanding properly. The hyper-resonant percussion note and reduced breath sounds on the right chest further support this diagnosis.

This impacts maternal physiology and some of the findings of pregnancy. Estrogen is such a hormone that increases markedly. Most of this estrogen is produced by which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Adrenals
B.  Fetus
C.  Ovaries
D.  Placenta
E.  Uterus

###Answer:",D,"During pregnancy, the majority of estrogen production is attributed to the placenta. The placenta plays a crucial role in hormone production to support the developing fetus and maintain pregnancy. While the ovaries contribute to estrogen production before pregnancy, they become less active during pregnancy. The fetus itself does produce some hormones, but the primary source of estrogen during pregnancy is the placenta.",Adrenals,Fetus,Ovaries,Placenta,Uterus,D,"D. Placenta

Rationale: Estrogen production increases significantly during pregnancy, with most of it produced by the placenta. The placenta produces estrogen from androgens produced by the fetal adrenal gland. The placenta converts these androgens into estrogen, which then enters the maternal circulation. This increased estrogen production has significant effects on maternal physiology, including changes in the reproductive tract, breasts, and other tissues.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the arteries
B.  Nitric oxide
C.  Inhibition of activity of the parasympathetic nerves leading to the arteries
D.  All of the above
E.  None of the above

Rationale: The correct answer is B. Nitric oxide. The resistance in the arteries leading to the sinuses of the penis is decreased by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons. NO stimulates the production of cyclic GMP, which leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle in the arteries and arterioles, resulting in increased blood flow to the penis. This is the mechanism by which erection occurs. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves (option A) would increase the resistance in the arteries, not decrease it. Inhibition of the parasympathetic nerves (option C) would also increase the resistance, as the parasympathetic nerves are involved in the erection process.",True,model6

Rationale: Peripartal cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of cardiomyopathy that occurs in the last month of pregnancy or in the first five months postpartum. The neurohormonal model is the best model that explains its pathophysiology. According to this model, the hormone prolactin is cleaved into a 16-kDa fragment that has a potent anti-angiogenic effect, leading to microvascular damage and subsequent cardiomyocyte injury. This model is supported by the observation that bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin secretion, has been shown to improve outcomes in PPCM patients.",False,model6

C.  Obtain pelvic ultrasonography
D.  Initiate oral contraceptives (OCs)
E.  Initiate cyclic progestin therapy

###Answer:",E,"The patient's history of irregular and heavy menstrual bleeding suggests a possible hormonal imbalance. Initiating cyclic progestin therapy can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce the heavy bleeding. This is a conservative approach that is often used as a first-line treatment for adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles. It is important to rule out pregnancy before initiating any hormonal therapy, but obtaining a pregnancy test is not the next best step in this case as the patient has been experiencing regular bleeding since menarche.",Obtain a pregnancy test,Perform an endometrial biopsy,Obtain pelvic ultrasonography,Initiate oral contraceptives (OCs),Initiate cyclic progestin therapy,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), which is common in adolescents. The first step in the management of DUB is to rule out pregnancy, so a pregnancy test should be obtained. After ruling out pregnancy, a thorough physical examination and medical history should be taken to identify any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the bleeding. If the patient is experiencing heavy bleeding, iron studies should be obtained to assess for anemia. If the patient's bleeding is not controlled with hormonal therapy, further evaluation with ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy may be necessary. However, these tests are not the next best step in the management of this patient's problem.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Insulin
B.  Glucagon

Rationale: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels during fasting or between meals. When blood glucose levels fall, glucagon is released, stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This helps to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Insulin, on the other hand, has the opposite effect, promoting glucose uptake by cells and reducing blood glucose levels. Cortisol, thyroxine, and epinephrine also play roles in glucose metabolism, but they are not primarily responsible for regulating blood glucose levels during fasting or between meals.",True,model6

Rationale: Folic acid deficiency can occur due to various reasons. These include:

1. **Inadequate dietary intake**: Vegetarian diet (option a) may lead to folic acid deficiency as the main sources of folate are green leafy vegetables, fruits, and legumes.

2. **Malabsorption**: Gluten enteropathy (option b) or celiac disease can lead to malabsorption of folate, resulting in deficiency.

3. **Increased demand**: Pregnancy (option c) increases the demand for folate, which can lead to deficiency if the diet is not supplemented.

4. **Chronic hemolytic anemia**: Hemolytic anemia (option d) can lead to increased destruction of red blood cells, resulting in increased demand for folate, which can lead to deficiency.

Rationale: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by inappropriate hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall, especially the interventricular septum. This leads to an increase in the thickness of the ventricular wall, which can obstruct the left ventricular outflow tract and impede blood flow.

D.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the embryos hypothalamus
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Human chorionic gonadotropin also binds to luteinizing hormone receptors on the interstitial cells of the testes of the male fetus, resulting in the production of testosterone in male fetuses up to the time of birth.

Rationale: During embryonic development, the testes produce testosterone in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from the placenta. hCG stimulates the production of testosterone from the testes, which is necessary for male differentiation to occur. The maternal pituitary gland does not produce luteinizing hormone (LH) that stimulates testosterone production in the embryo. Inhibin is a hormone produced by the corpus luteum that inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production, but it does not stimulate testosterone production.

Rationale: 
Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Elevated blood pressure can cause damage to the inner lining of the coronary arteries, making them more susceptible to the development of atherosclerosis and CAD.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (Option A) are inversely related to the risk of CAD, meaning that higher levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with a lower risk of CAD.

Regular physical activity (Option B) is also associated with a lower risk of CAD, as it can help to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of other CAD risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes.

A Mediterranean diet (Option D) is a dietary pattern that has been associated with a lower risk of CAD, likely due to its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats.

Liver disease (Option E) is not a traditional risk factor for CAD, although some liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, may be associated with an increased risk of CAD due to their association with insulin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities.",True,model6

Rationale: The woman is experiencing symptoms of perimenopause, including irregular menses and hot flashes. However, she may still be ovulating and is at risk for pregnancy. Natural family planning is not a reliable method of contraception for a woman with irregular cycles. While checking FSH levels may help determine if she is approaching menopause, it will not provide immediate relief from her symptoms or protect her from pregnancy. A low dose combination hormonal contraceptive can help regulate her cycles, reduce hot flashes, and provide reliable contraception.

###Options:
A.  Aldosterone
B.  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
C.  Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
D.  Renin
E.  Parathyroid hormone (PTH)

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is option (A) Aldosterone. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It acts on the kidneys to promote sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, helping to regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure.",Aldosterone,Antidiuretic hormone (ADH),Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),Renin,Parathyroid hormone (PTH),A,"A. Aldosterone

Rationale: Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure. It promotes the reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys, leading to increased sodium levels in the blood. Simultaneously, aldosterone stimulates the excretion of potassium ions, which helps maintain potassium homeostasis. This is why option A is the correct answer.

Option B, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is involved in regulating water reabsorption in the kidneys, not sodium and potassium levels.

Option C, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), is a hormone produced by the heart that promotes sodium excretion and potassium retention, which is the opposite of aldosterone's effects.

Option D, renin, is an enzyme produced by the kidneys that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone production, but it is not directly responsible for sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion.

Rationale: 
The most important follow-up investigation in a young child with UTI is an ultrasound of the kidneys and renal tract. This is because UTI in children is often associated with underlying congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT), such as vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, and renal dysplasia.

The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Antithrombin deficiency
B.  Factor V Leiden mutation
C.  Protein S deficiency
D.  Lupus anticoagulant
E.  Protein C deficiency

###Answer:",B,"This patient is suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and appears to have a history of recurrent DVTs, the occurrence of which at a young age is suggestive of an inherited disorder of coagulation. Factor V Leiden (B) is a mutation of factor V which makes it resistant to the action of protein C. The increased presence of factor V therefore creates a procoagulant state predisposing to pathology such as DVTs. Factor V Leiden is one of the most common causes of an inherited procoagulant state, present in approximately 5 per cent of the Caucasian population. Although protein C (E), protein S (C) and antithrombin deficiency (A) would also cause a procoagulant state, they are much rarer. Lupus anticoagulant (D) antibodies cross-react with phospholipids and can be associated with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The antibodies also create a procoagulant state and patients may suffer from arterial and venous thrombosis.",Antithrombin deficiency,Factor V Leiden mutation,Protein S deficiency,Lupus anticoagulant,Protein C deficiency,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms suggest a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common presentation of thrombophilia. The patient's family history and personal history of recurrent episodes suggest an inherited disorder. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common inherited cause of thrombophilia, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is consistent with the patient's family history. The other options are also inherited causes of thrombophilia, but they are less common than Factor V Leiden mutation.",True,model6

###Answer:",D,"In individuals with AIDS presenting with a CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 alongside symptoms of odynophagia, esophageal candidiasis is identifiable in approximately 90% of cases. Given the notably elevated probability of Candida infection in AIDS patients, empirical therapy represents a viable approach for confirming diagnosis in such instances.

Should initial treatment fail to yield desired outcomes, subsequent consideration should be given to performing an endoscopic examination.",Serum candida antigen,Chest computed tomography (CT),Endoscopy,Fluconazole,Stool candida culture,D,"D. Fluconazole

Rationale: 
In individuals with AIDS, odynophagia is often caused by esophageal candidiasis. Since the CD4 cell count is below 100 cells/mm3, empiric treatment with fluconazole is recommended initially. This is because esophageal candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. Endoscopy may be required later if symptoms persist or if there are concerns about other diagnoses.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a myopathy, particularly the difficulty with climbing stairs and rising from a low chair, which suggests proximal muscle weakness. The EMG findings support this diagnosis. The lack of family history and the patient's age make it less likely that this is a familial myopathy. The presence of severe type 2 respiratory failure suggests that the myopathy is severe and may be related to a metabolic disorder.

Rationale: 
A diagnosis of epilepsy is primarily made on clinical grounds, based on the patient's history and description of the seizure episode(s). The presence of recurrent unprovoked seizures is the hallmark of epilepsy. While EEG can be a useful diagnostic tool, it is not necessary for diagnosis. In this case, the patient's history is consistent with epilepsy, and a clinical diagnosis can be made. EEG may be used to support the diagnosis, but it is not essential.

###Options:
A.  Persistent omphalomesenteric duct
B.  Persistent urachus
C.  Failed obliteration of the umbilical ring
D.  Omphalocele
E.  Patent ductus arteriosus

###Answer:",C,"During fetal development, the primitive umbilical ring appears as early as 4th week of gestation on the ventral surface of the body. It contains umbilical vessels (one vein and two arteries), allantois, vitelline duct, vitelline vessels and loop of midgut. As the herniated midgut reduces, the definitive umbilical cord will develop containing the umbilical vessels surrounded by Wharton's jelly.

The umbilical vessels obliterate after birth and will be replaced by a ligamentous structure. Congenital disorders of the umbilicus include umbilical hernia, patent urachus, omphalomesenteric fistula, and umbilical polyp. It is important to recognize these defects as early as possible is essential to prevent complications.

A persistent omphalomesenteric duct is associated with an umbilical fistula, sinus, or polyp. Omphalocele is a central abdominal wall defect with an absent umbilicus. A persistent urachus is associated with an umbilical fistula, sinus, or polyp.

Failure of obliteration of the umbilical ring after separation of the umbilical cord predisposes to the development of an umbilical hernia.

###Options:
A.  Perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies
B.  Perform random cervical biopsies
C.  Order HPV typing on the initial Pap smear
D.  Repeat the Pap smear to obtain endocervical cells
E.  Perform a cone biopsy of the cervix

###Answer:",A,"Any patient with a Pap smear result suggesting cervical dysplasia should undergo colposcopy, a procedure that allows for the magnified examination of the cervix. The colposcope provides a view at 10 to 16 times magnification. Pap smear is a cytological screening test for cervical neoplasms. A Pap smear result indicating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) may indicate moderate or severe cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.During colposcopy, 3% acetic acid is applied to the cervix, which helps visualize abnormal blood vessels or acetowhite areas indicating dysplasia. Any abnormal areas observed are biopsied for histologic analysis. Patients with an HGSIL Pap smear result do not require repeat testing or HPV testing, as the cytological findings suggest cervical neoplasia. Repeat Pap smear testing could yield false-negative results, delaying necessary treatment. Random cervical biopsies are not recommended as they may miss the actual abnormal tissue.Indications for a cone biopsy include unsatisfactory colposcopic examination, a colposcopically directed biopsy indicating possible invasive disease, neoplasm in the endocervix, or discrepancies between cervical biopsy results and Pap smear findings. The absence of endocervical cells in an otherwise normal Pap smear does not necessitate repeat testing. However, in such cases, endocervical curettage is recommended to evaluate the endocervical canal for neoplasia.",Perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies,Perform random cervical biopsies,Order HPV typing on the initial Pap smear,Repeat the Pap smear to obtain endocervical cells,Perform a cone biopsy of the cervix,A,"A

Rationale: The patient has a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) on her Pap smear, which is a high-risk result. The next step in management would be to perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies to further evaluate the abnormality. Colposcopy is a procedure that uses a specialized microscope to examine the cervix and allows the healthcare provider to visualize the abnormal cells and take directed biopsies of any suspicious areas. This will help to determine the extent and severity of the abnormality and guide further management. Options B, C, D, and E are not the most appropriate next steps in management. Random cervical biopsies are not typically performed, as they are not as accurate as directed biopsies taken during colposcopy. HPV typing may be useful in certain situations, but it is not the next step in management for a patient with a high-grade lesion. Repeating the Pap smear to obtain endocervical cells is not necessary, as the Pap smear has already shown a high-grade lesion. A cone biopsy of the cervix may be necessary in the future, but it is not the next step in management.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient is 16 weeks pregnant with a history of elevated blood pressure (150/100 mmHg) 4 weeks earlier, indicating chronic hypertension. The current blood pressure is 155/105 mmHg, which is further elevated. Additionally, the patient has proteinuria (+ protein on urinalysis, 35 mg/mmol spot urinary protein/creatinine ratio, and 0.35 g protein on 24-h urine collection).

He has a history of porphyria. The provider decides on an emergency surgery to manage the fractures. What is the mechanism of action of the drug that should be avoided in the perioperative period?
###Options:
A.  Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid
B.  Blocks the receptor site for epinephrine and norepinephrine
C.  Corrects hyponatremia
D.  Acts on GABA receptors causing post-synaptic inhibition
E.  Corrects hypernatremia

###Answer:",D,"Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for the treatment of seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure, and the induction of anesthesia.

Barbiturates are linked to the postsynaptic enhancement of GABA, interacting with alpha and beta subunits of the GABA receptor. Barbiturates increase chloride ion flux, which results in GABA-induced postsynaptic inhibition.

Barbiturates are known to precipitate a porphyria attack and should be avoided.

Intravenous infusion of heme is considered the first-line treatment for an acute attack. Beta-blockers are indicated for the treatment of sympathetic stimulation from a painful attack. Patients with an acute attack of porphyria should have high carbohydrate intravenous fluids (dextrose 10%). Chronic porphyria patients may exhibit hyponatremia.",Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid,Blocks the receptor site for epinephrine and norepinephrine,Corrects hyponatremia,Acts on GABA receptors causing post-synaptic inhibition,Corrects hypernatremia,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient has a history of porphyria, so the provider should avoid using succinylcholine, a depolarizing muscle relaxant, during anesthesia. Succinylcholine can cause a significant increase in potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. The mechanism of action of succinylcholine is by blocking the receptor site for acetylcholine, not epinephrine and norepinephrine. The correct answer is B.

###Options:
A.  LH secretion rate is elevated
B.  LH secretion rate is suppressed
C.  FSH secretion rate is suppressed
D.  No corpus luteum is present

Rationale: Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary. If there is no corpus luteum present, progesterone levels will be minimal. This could be due to a failure of ovulation, or a failure of the corpus luteum to form or persist after ovulation. The other options do not directly explain why progesterone levels are low. LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, but their levels do not directly determine progesterone levels. Inhibin is a hormone that inhibits FSH secretion, but it does not directly affect progesterone synthesis.",True,model6

African endemic relapsing fever is caused by Borrelia duttonii, which is transmitted by the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata. This disease is also known as tick-borne relapsing fever. It is characterized by recurring episodes of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and swelling of the lymph nodes. Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia recurrentis causes louse-borne relapsing fever, Borrelia hermsii causes tick-borne relapsing fever in the United States, and Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever agent found in hard ticks.",True,model6

She has lived in the mountains at 10,000 feet above sea level for 2 years; thephysicians office is located at sea level. Her pulse is 85/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mmHg. Physical examination while sitting upright shows jugular venous distention and 2  pedal edema. During the past 2years, which of the following has most likely decreased in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Height of P waves in lead I of the patient's ECG
B.  Height of R waves in lead V1 of the patient's ECG
C.  Hematocrit
D.  Pulmonary vascular resistance
E.  Right ventricular diastolic compliance

###Answer:",E,"Living at high altitudes for an extended period can lead to chronic hypoxia, which can result in pulmonary hypertension and remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, including changes in right ventricular function. One of the adaptations in response to chronic hypoxia is increased right ventricular diastolic compliance.Chronic hypoxia leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, which eventually results in right ventricular hypertrophy. The hypertrophied right ventricle can adapt by becoming more compliant during diastole to accommodate the increased preload associated with the higher pulmonary vascular resistance.Therefore, in this patient who has been living at high altitude for 2 years, it is likely that right ventricular diastolic compliance has increased as an adaptive response to chronic hypoxia and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.So, the answer to the question is:(E) Right ventricular diastolic compliance",Height of P waves in lead I of the patient's ECG,Height of R waves in lead V1 of the patient's ECG,Hematocrit,Pulmonary vascular resistance,Right ventricular diastolic compliance,D,"D. Pulmonary vascular resistance

Rationale: The patient is likely experiencing high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) due to her recent descent from high altitude to sea level. At high altitudes, the low oxygen levels cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance. This increase in resistance can lead to right ventricular failure and subsequent HAPE. At sea level, oxygen levels are higher, and pulmonary vascular resistance would decrease. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with right heart failure, which is a complication of HAPE.

B.  Dopamine
C.  Endorphins
D.  Oxytocin
E.  Norepinephrine

###Answer:",A,"Serotonin is primarily associated with the regulation of mood and emotional processing. It plays a key role in modulating emotions, anxiety, and depression. Serotonin is involved in various physiological functions, including mood regulation, sleep, appetite, and digestion. Imbalances in serotonin levels have been linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety.

Fourweeks ago she noted a small vulvar ulceration that spontaneously healed.Now there is painful inguinal adenopathy associated with malaise andfever. You are considering the diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum(LGV). The diagnosis can be established by which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Staining for Donovan bodies
B.  Culturing Calymmatobacterium granulomatis
C.  Culturing Haemophilus ducreyi
D.  Positive Frei skin test
E.  The presence of serum antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis

###Answer:",E,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a chronic infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, predominantly found in tropical regions. The primary infection typically begins as a painless ulcer on the labia or vaginal vestibule. Patients often seek medical attention several weeks after the development of painful adenopathy in the inguinal and perirectal areas. Diagnosis can be confirmed by culture or by detecting serum antibodies to C. trachomatis. The Frei skin test is no longer utilized due to its low sensitivity. The differential diagnosis for LGV includes syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, carcinoma, and herpes. Chancroid, caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, presents as a painful, tender ulceration of the vulva. Granuloma inguinale, caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, is characterized by the presence of Donovan bodies in affected patients. Treatment for both granuloma inguinale and LGV involves the administration of tetracycline antibiotics. Chancroid can be effectively treated with azithromycin or ceftriaxone.",Staining for Donovan bodies,Culturing Calymmatobacterium granulomatis,Culturing Haemophilus ducreyi,Positive Frei skin test,The presence of serum antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis,D,"D

Rationale: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, and L3. The Frei skin test is a diagnostic test for LGV, which involves injecting a patient with a suspension of inactivated LGV bacteria. A positive reaction, characterized by a local inflammatory response, indicates a past or current infection with LGV. Although serologic tests can detect antibodies to C. trachomatis, they are not specific for LGV and may not distinguish between LGV and other chlamydial infections. Donovan bodies are seen in granuloma inguinale, not LGV. Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a different sexually transmitted disease.

The pain is dull, worse in between meals, and is 5/10 in intensity. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heavy smoking. The physical examination shows discomfort in the epigastric area. An upper endoscopy shows an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Biopsy of the stomach lining reveals inflammation affecting the antrum but sparing the body and the fundus, as well as colonization by Helicobacter pylori and decreased numbers of D cells. Which of the following is expected to be seen in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Decreased gastrin due to loss of G cells
B.  Decreased gastrin due to loss of C cells

E.  Hypoplasia of gastrin-releasing G cells

###Answer:",C,"The clinical vignette describes a patient with non-atrophic chronic gastritis caused by colonization of the gastric antrum with Helicobacter pylori.

The inflammatory process in the antrum decreases the number of somatostatin-producing delta cells (D cells).

Somatostatin is an inhibitory hormone that suppresses gastrin secretion from G cells and pepsinogen secretion from chief cells. Gastrin is a stimulatory hormone that increases gastric H ions secretion and stimulates pepsinogen production.

Loss of inhibitory signals from somatostatin leads to enhanced pepsinogen secretion both directly and indirectly through increased gastrin production. High gastrin levels in non-atrophic chronic gastritis predispose to duodenal ulcers due to the high acidity reaching the duodenum.",Decreased gastrin due to loss of G cells,Decreased gastrin due to loss of C cells,ncreased pepsinogen secretion due to high levels of gastrin,Decreased pepsin activation due to high pH,Hypoplasia of gastrin-releasing G cells,C,"C.

Rationale: The patient has a duodenal ulcer and is infected with Helicobacter pylori. The biopsy shows inflammation affecting the antrum but sparing the body and the fundus, which is consistent with an antral-predominant gastritis. This type of gastritis is associated with increased gastrin levels due to decreased somatostatin production by D cells in the antrum. Increased gastrin levels stimulate the release of pepsinogen from chief cells in the stomach, leading to increased pepsinogen secretion.",True,model6

E.  Cyclosporiasis

###Answer:",A,"The man's HIV infection and poor adherence to ART indicate an immunocompromised state. Cryptosporidiosis is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Chronic diarrhea and weight loss are hallmark symptoms of cryptosporidiosis.

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and abdominal pain are consistent with gastrointestinal opportunistic infections. Given his poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, his CD4 count is likely to be low, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections. Among the options, Cryptosporidiosis is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS. The other options, Microsporidiosis, Isosporiasis, and Cyclosporiasis, are also opportunistic infections that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but they are less common than Cryptosporidiosis.

###Options:
A.  Organelles
B.  Ribosomes
C.  DNA
D.  Chromosomes
E.  RNA

###Answer:",E,"The dark blue staining of reticulum in the reticulocyte with new methylene blue N stain is due to RNA. RNA is a molecule involved in protein synthesis and is abundant in the reticulocyte, which is a young red blood cell. The staining technique used specifically targets RNA, resulting in the dark blue coloration. Organelles, ribosomes, and DNA are not directly responsible for this staining.",Organelles,Ribosomes,DNA,Chromosomes,RNA,E,"E

Rationale: Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that still have some ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in their cytoplasm. The new methylene blue N stain is a supravital stain that binds to the RNA in the reticulocyte, causing it to appear dark blue. This staining pattern is useful for identifying reticulocytes in peripheral blood smears. As reticulocytes mature into erythrocytes, they lose their RNA and no longer stain with new methylene blue N.",True,model6

C.  Endometrium
D.  Stromal cells of the ovaries E) Anterior pituitary gland
E.  Anterior pituitary gland

###Answer:",B,"In the non-pregnant female, the only significant source of estrogen is ovarian follicles or corpus luteae. Menstruation begins when the corpus luteum degenerates. Menstruation ends when developing follicles secrete estrogen sufficiently to raise circulating concentration to a level that stimulates regrowth of the endometrium.",Corpus luteum,Developing follicles,Endometrium,Stromal cells of the ovaries E) Anterior pituitary gland,Anterior pituitary gland,B,"B. Developing follicles

Rationale: As menstruation ends, estrogen levels in the blood rise rapidly. This is due to the development of new follicles in the ovaries, which start to produce estrogen. The estrogen produced by these developing follicles stimulates the growth and proliferation of the endometrium, preparing it for a potential pregnancy. The corpus luteum, which forms from the ruptured follicle after ovulation, produces progesterone, not estrogen. The endometrium and stromal cells of the ovaries do not produce significant amounts of estrogen. The anterior pituitary gland produces hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle, but it does not produce estrogen itself.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"Hepatitis B and C infections are common causes of cirrhosis and are strongly linked to hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C, uniquely, can also lead to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, often in the spleen, which may resolve with hepatitis C cure. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in various lymphoid malignancies, such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), Hodgkins disease, central nervous system lymphoma, and Burkitts lymphoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is a necessary and sufficient factor for gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, which can be cured by eradicating the organism in some cases. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) is a known cause of body cavity lymphoma, including primary pleural lymphoma. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is associated with adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia.

Hyperopia, nystagmus, and strabismus are less likely in this case as they do not specifically match the symptoms described.",Presbyopia,Hyperopia,Nystagmus,Astigmatism,Stabismus,A,"A

Rationale: Presbyopia is a common age-related condition characterized by a gradual decline in near vision due to the loss of elasticity and flexibility of the lens in the eye. As people age, the lens becomes less able to change shape and focus on close objects, leading to difficulty reading, threading a needle, or performing other daily tasks that require near vision. The symptoms of presbyopia typically begin in the early to mid-40s, which is consistent with the patient's age in this scenario.",True,model6

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with erythema nodosum, a condition characterized by painful, swollen, and erythematous areas on the extremities. The patient's dark complexion and conjunctival icterus suggest underlying liver disease, which can cause hyperlipidemia and hypertension. The presence of a cord-like area in the medial distal left thigh suggests thrombophlebitis. Given the patient's history of similar episodes, it is likely that he has a underlying condition that predisposes him to thrombosis, such as a hypercoagulable state.

D.  Prothrombin 20210G
E.  Tissue plasminogen activator

###Answer:",B,"Venous thrombosis primarily arises from activation of the coagulation cascade via exposure to tissue factor, with genetic predispositions often involving polymorphisms affecting procoagulant or fibrinolytic pathways. Conversely, arterial thrombosis occurs due to platelet activation, with genetic predispositions commonly involving mutations affecting platelet receptors or redox enzymes.The most frequent inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis include the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin 20210 mutation. Additional mutations contributing to venous thrombosis susceptibility encompass inherited deficiencies of protein C or S, as well as mutations affecting fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator, thrombomodulin, or plasminogen activator inhibitor.However, the glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutation increases the risk of arterial thrombosis but not venous thrombosis.",Factor V Leiden mutation,Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor,Heterozygous protein C deficiency,Prothrombin 20210G,Tissue plasminogen activator,E,"E
Rationale: Options A, C, and D are all associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, and it causes resistance to activated protein C. Heterozygous protein C deficiency is another genetic mutation that increases the risk of deep-vein thrombosis. Prothrombin 20210G is a genetic mutation that increases the risk of deep-vein thrombosis by increasing the amount of prothrombin in the blood. Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor (option B) is not a well-established risk factor for deep-vein thrombosis. Tissue plasminogen activator (option E) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of blood clots, and its deficiency would actually decrease the risk of deep-vein thrombosis.",False,model6

His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination of the left hand shows diffuse swelling, erythema, and a 2-cm, necrotic puncture wound. His leukocyte count is 14,000/mm3. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a PCO2 of less than 32 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely infectious agent in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Clostridium tetani
B.  Mycobacterium abscessus

###Answer:",E,"Given the clinical presentation of sudden onset fever, shortness of breath, palpitations, along with a puncture wound to the hand, diffuse swelling, erythema, and necrotic puncture wound, along with leukocytosis and low arterial PCO2, the most likely infectious agent in this patient is:(E) Staphylococcus aureu",Clostridium tetani,Mycobacterium abscessus,Pasteurella multocida,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,E,"E. Staphylococcus aureus

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and palpitations, suggest a severe infection, likely sepsis. The presence of a necrotic wound on the hand and the patient's occupation as a carpenter suggest a skin and soft tissue infection, likely caused by a Gram-positive bacterium. The rapid progression of the infection and the patient's systemic symptoms are consistent with a toxin-mediated infection. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections and can produce toxins, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, that can cause a rapid onset of severe symptoms. Clostridium tetani is unlikely, as it typically causes tetanus, a neurological disorder, rather than sepsis. Mycobacterium abscessus is a rare cause of skin and soft tissue infections and typically causes chronic, rather than acute, infections. Pasteurella multocida is typically associated with animal bites, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Ataxia
B.  Delayed relaxation of ankle jerk
C.  Hypotonia
D.  Hyper reflexia

###Answer:",B,"In the vast majority of cases hypothyroidism results from an intrinsic disorder of the thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism). In this situation serum T4 is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mU/L. Measurements of serum T3 are unhelpful since they do not discriminate reliably between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The rare condition of secondary hypothyroidism is caused by failure of TSH secretion in a patient with hypothalamic or anterior pituitary disease. This is characterised by a low serum T4 but TSH may be low, normal or even slightly elevated . Other non-specific abnormalities are shown In severe prolonged hypothyroidism, the electrocardiogram (ECG) classically demonstrates sinus bradycardia with low-voltage complexes and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. Measurement of thyroid peroxidase antibodies is helpful, but further investigations are rarely required ",Ataxia,Delayed relaxation of ankle jerk,Hypotonia,Hyper reflexia,Loss of sensations,B,"B

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of hypothyroidism, which is confirmed by the presence of goiter. The most likely finding on central nervous system examination in a patient with hypothyroidism would be delayed relaxation of ankle jerk, which is a classic sign of hypothyroidism. Delayed relaxation of ankle jerk is due to the decreased breakdown of ATP in hypothyroidism, leading to prolonged muscle contraction.",True,model6

Plasma volume decreases due to diuresis and haemoconcentration

Rationale: During pregnancy, there is an increase in plasma volume to accommodate the growing fetus. After delivery, the uterus begins to involute, and there is a shift of fluid from the intravascular space to the extravascular space, resulting in diuresis. This leads to a decrease in plasma volume, causing the hematocrit to rise. This is a normal physiological response in the postpartum period.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"Cortical atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques are characteristic morphologic changes seen in Alzheimer's disease. Cortical atrophy refers to the shrinking of the cerebral cortex, which is a hallmark feature of the disease. Neurofibrillary tangles are abnormal protein aggregates that form inside nerve cells, disrupting their normal function. Neuritic plaques, also known as senile plaques, are clumps of beta-amyloid protein that accumulate between nerve cells.

Cortical atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques

Rationale: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by three main morphologic changes: 
1. Cortical atrophy: There is a significant loss of neurons and a decrease in brain weight, leading to a decrease in the size of the brain, especially in the cerebral cortex.
2. Neurofibrillary tangles: These are abnormal collections of twisted protein filaments found within neurons. They are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and are thought to be a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
3. Neuritic plaques: These are extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid protein, a 39-43 amino acid peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein. They are found in the cerebral cortex and are thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

The other options are not accurate. Lewy bodies are characteristic of Parkinson's disease, not Alzheimer's disease. Watershed liquefactive necrosis is a type of infarction that occurs in the brain due to hypoperfusion, but it is not a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease.

OCPs can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and improve acne and hirsutism. Additionally, OCPs can reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer associated with PCOS. Metformin may be considered for patients with insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, but it is not the primary treatment for PCOS. Spironolactone is an androgen receptor blocker that can be used to treat hirsutism, but it is not a first-line treatment. Weight loss can be beneficial for patients with PCOS, but it is not a primary treatment. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is a surgical procedure that may be considered for patients with PCOS who have not responded to medical therapy, but it is not an initial management option.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Gestational trophoblastic disease
B.  Urinary oncontinence
C.  Bowel perforation
D.  Uterine perforation

###Answer:",D,"In the post partum period, the uterus is softer and thinner thus surgical evacuation carries a greater risk of uterine perforation.",Gestational trophoblastic disease,Urinary oncontinence,Bowel perforation,Uterine perforation,,D,"D. Uterine perforation

Rationale: Uterine perforation is a recognized complication of surgical evacuation of retained products of conception. This is because the surgeon may inadvertently puncture the uterus with the suction curette or other instruments during the procedure. The risk of uterine perforation is higher in cases where the uterus is scarred or where there is a significant amount of retained tissue. Gestational trophoblastic disease is not a complication of surgical evacuation of retained products of conception, but rather a condition that may require surgical evacuation. Urinary incontinence and bowel perforation are not typically associated with surgical evacuation of retained products of conception.",True,model6

He has severe nausea and finds it difficult to stand. He feels frail and easily falls if he attempts to get up from the sitting position. He feels warmer than usual and noticed a lump in the neck at about the same time as symptom onset. Physical examination reveals an acutely ill patient, and he has tender peripheral lymph nodes, most evident in the neck and groin. He is sweating a lot, and his pulse rate is 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 70/50 mmHg. He will most likely require treatment using which of the following?
###Options:
A.  Antihistamines
B.  NSAIDS
C.  Corticosteroids
D.  Antipyretics
E.  Antibiotics

###Answer:",C,"This patient is experiencing a Mazzotti reaction which is known to occur mostly following the ingestion of DEC but can also occur as a reaction to Ivermectin ingestion.

The patients experience severe hypotension and adenitis and can be fatal if not promptly managed. Research into the treatment of the Mazzotti reaction has shown that the administration of a low dose of dexamethasone (3 mg/day), started after the onset of the Mazzotti reaction, modifies the progression of the Mazzotti reaction without interfering with the microfilaricidal efficacy of DEC.

Pretreatment with low-dose dexamethasone (before DEC therapy) prevents the development of the Mazzotti reaction and dramatically reduces the microfilaricidal activity of DEC. However use of diphenhydramine, after the onset of the Mazzotti reaction, had no effect on the course and intensity of the Mazzotti reaction nor microfilaricidal activity.

Though antihistamines and antipyretics may find use in treating associated nausea and fever, the mainstay of treatment remains systemic administration of corticosteroids.",Antihistamines,NSAIDS,Corticosteroids,Antipyretics,Antibiotics,C,"C. Corticosteroids

Rationale: The patient is experiencing a Mazzotti reaction, which is a systemic allergic reaction to the dying microfilariae. The symptoms are caused by the release of endotoxins from the dying parasites, which leads to an inflammatory response. Corticosteroids are often used to treat this reaction by reducing the inflammation and alleviating symptoms. Antihistamines, NSAIDS, antipyretics, and antibiotics may provide some relief, but corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for this condition.",True,model6

Therefore, the correct answer is:(A) Binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors",Binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors,Binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,Inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to 50S ribosomal subunits and preventing peptide bond formation,Inhibition of protein synthesis via loss of DNA helical structure,Interference with bacterial wall synthesis,C,"C. Inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to 50S ribosomal subunits and preventing peptide bond formation

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of bilateral swelling of the parotid and submandibular glands, discoloration of several teeth, and scarring on the dorsum of the right hand suggest a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. The patient's current symptoms of mouth pain on the inside of both cheeks suggest a diagnosis of oral ulcers, which are a common side effect of fluoxetine. The patient's eating disorder and oral ulcers are likely related to the fluoxetine, which can cause oral ulcers in some patients. To treat the oral ulcers, a medication with a mechanism of action that inhibits protein synthesis via binding to 50S ribosomal subunits and preventing peptide bond formation, such as sucralfate, is most appropriate.

Rationale: The rumbling diastolic sound is a characteristic finding of mitral stenosis, which is typically heard in mid-diastole. The murmur is caused by the flow of blood through the stenotic mitral valve. The sound is described as a low-pitched rumbling or whooping sound.

The patient's history of excessive sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis are all consistent with this diagnosis. Modafinil is a medication that is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. It is a wakefulness-promoting agent that can help increase alertness and reduce sleepiness. Weight reduction may be helpful in improving sleep quality, but it is not a specific treatment for narcolepsy.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause cough and fatigue but would also be more likely to have weight loss and night sweats. Erythema multiforme is also not seen with mycobacterium tuberculosis. Whilst haemophilus influenzae can cause pneumonia it is more common in children rather than adults. Legionella pneumophilia can cause a dry cough which later becomes productive with some extra pulmonary symptoms but is more common with a high fever and without any skin changes.,Haemophilus influenzae,Legionella pneumophilia,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,C,"C. Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, including headache, vomiting, and malaise, are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of a low-grade fever and a dry cough also support this diagnosis. The ""target lesions"" on the patient's body are likely erythema multiforme, which is a known complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, and it often affects young adults, particularly those living in close quarters, such as in barracks.",True,model6

She reports von Willebrand disease in her family history although says she has never been tested. A weight-based dose of desmopressin is administered, and she is discharged home. She returns to 12 hours later with significant oral and nasal mucosal bleeding, an extensive petechial rash, and purpura on the lower extremities and trunk. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's new symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Delayed allergic reaction to desmopressin
B.  Thrombocytopenia
C.  Thrombocytosis
D.  Expired desmopressin
E.  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy

###Answer:",B,"Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder caused by low or dysfunctional levels of the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor. Desmopressin is a common way to treat most types of vWD but is controversial in Type 2b because of its risk of thrombocytopenia.

Type 2b, a genetic variant of the disease, is one of the most difficult subtypes of von Willebrand disease to treat. In Type 2b, there is a gain-of-function aspect in which there is an enhanced interaction between vWF and platelets resulting in abnormal glycoprotein complexes causing consumptive thrombocytopenia. This patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia as a result of her underlying diagnosis of Type 2b von Willebrand disease and the exposure to desmopressin.

Desmopressin is considered a contraindication in von Willebrand Type 2b because it enhances and increases the number of glycoprotein complexes, promoting platelet aggregation leading to clinically significant thrombocytopenia with an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding. Desmopressin should not be given to patients with this subtype.

The correct treatment for a patient with Type 2b von Willebrand disease should be von Willebrand Factor replacement and in some cases, a platelet transfusion may be needed. Adjunct therapy with antifibrinolytics is also recommended.",Delayed allergic reaction to desmopressin,Thrombocytopenia,Thrombocytosis,Expired desmopressin,Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy,B,"B. Thrombocytopenia

Rationale: Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin that stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor (VWF) from endothelial cells. It is commonly used to treat bleeding in patients with von Willebrand disease. However, desmopressin can also cause thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients who have not been previously treated with the medication. The thrombocytopenia is usually mild and reversible but can be severe in some cases. In this scenario, the patient's symptoms are consistent with thrombocytopenia, which is the most likely cause of her bleeding.",True,model6

However, today, he presents with symptoms including fever, ataxia, weakness, headache, and emesis. During his time in the office, he experiences a left-sided tonic-clonic seizure lasting for 3 minutes. In light of these developments, you have deemed it necessary to transfer him to the hospital for further evaluation. Furthermore, you have initiated the process of conducting a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. The subsequent findings from the MRI reveal disseminated multifocal white matter lesions that exhibit enhancement with contrast. Given this clinical presentation, which of the following diagnoses is most likely for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
B.  Bacterial meningitis
C.  Neurocysticercosis
D.  Multiple sclerosis
E.  Malignant astrocytoma

###Answer:",A,"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating autoimmune disorder typically observed in children under the age of 10. Its onset can be triggered by various infections, encompassing upper respiratory tract infections, varicella, mycoplasma, herpes simplex virus, rubella, rubeola, mumps, as well as vaccinations. Clinical presentation and examination findings may resemble those of multiple sclerosis; however, notable distinctions include the age of onset (typically under 10 years old), systemic manifestations such as fever and emesis, and the absence of lesion progression post-identification. Mortality rates are considerable, ranging from 10% to 30% among affected individuals. High-dose corticosteroids constitute the primary therapeutic approach. While MRI is not typically diagnostic for meningitis, lumbar puncture remains the preferred diagnostic modality. Furthermore, the MRI characteristics described are not indicative of malignancies or neurocysticercosis (central nervous system infection by Taenia solium).",Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,Bacterial meningitis,Neurocysticercosis,Multiple sclerosis,Malignant astrocytoma,A,"A

Rationale: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare autoimmune disease that typically follows a viral infection or vaccination. The symptoms described, including fever, ataxia, weakness, headache, and emesis, are consistent with ADEM. The MRI findings of disseminated multifocal white matter lesions that exhibit enhancement with contrast also support this diagnosis. ADEM is characterized by a monophasic illness, which means that it occurs once and then resolves, unlike multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic condition. Bacterial meningitis is unlikely given the MRI findings, and neurocysticercosis would typically present with seizures and calcified lesions on imaging.

###Options:
A.  Alkaline aminotransferase
B.  Alkaline phosphatase
C.  Aspartate aminotransferase
D.  Lactate dehydrogenase
E.  Pyruvate kinase

###Answer:",B,Ref: Cholestatic Jaundice (Page 946) Davidsons Principles and  Practice of Medicine,Alkaline aminotransferase,Alkaline phosphatase,Aspartate aminotransferase,Lactate dehydrogenase,Pyruvate kinase,B,"B

Rationale: The symptoms mentioned in the question, such as jaundice, pruritis, and clay-colored stools, are indicative of an obstructive liver disease, likely due to a blockage in the bile duct. In such cases, the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are typically elevated. ALP is an enzyme produced by the liver and bones, and its levels can increase in response to liver or bone damage. In obstructive liver disease, the bile duct obstruction leads to an increase in ALP production, resulting in elevated levels. The other options, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are also liver enzymes, but they are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage rather than obstructive liver disease. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in various tissues, and its levels may increase in response to tissue damage, but it is not specifically related to liver disease. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis and is not typically associated with liver disease.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is hidradenitis suppurativa. This is supported by the presence of recurrent, painful, draining vulvar lesions with multiple abscesses and deep scars in the labia. The foul-smelling discharge and occasional appearance of similar lesions in the axilla further suggest hidradenitis suppurativa, which is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the apocrine sweat glands. Herpetic vulvitis, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale, and secondary syphilis are less likely as they do not typically present with the same clinical features as described in the case.",Herpetic vulvitis,Hidradenitis suppurativa,Lymphogranuloma venereum,Granuloma inguinale,Secondary syphilis,B,"B.

Rationale: 
Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent, painful, and draining abscesses and nodules in the apocrine-gland-bearing areas of the body, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks. The vulva is a common site for these lesions, and the presence of deep scars and foul-smelling discharge are consistent with this diagnosis. The occurrence of similar lesions in the axilla further supports this diagnosis. Herpetic vulvitis typically presents with painful, grouped vesicles, whereas lymphogranuloma venereum is characterized by a painless ulcer and later, lymphadenopathy. Granuloma inguinale typically presents with a painless, bleeding ulcer, and secondary syphilis is characterized by a rash and lymphadenopathy.",True,model6

The ectopic gastric epithelium is present in about half of patients and can cause ulcers and painless bleeding but does not generally cause severe pain unless inflammation occurs.

Meckel diverticulum occurs on the antimesenteric border of the ileum and can bleed. The 60% of cases that contain gastric mucosa can be detected with a Meckel scan. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pertechnetate is absorbed preferentially by the gastric mucosa and thus may be used to detect ectopic gastric mucosa in the diverticulum.

D.  Air embolism
E.  GERD

###Answer:",A,"Patients with anorexia nervosa, hyperemesis, alcohol use disorder, or malabsorption syndromes who are started on enteral feeding are prone to develop the refeeding syndrome.

Hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of refeeding syndrome.

Hypophosphatemia can cause rhabdomyolysis, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, muscular weakness, leukocyte dysfunction, seizure, coma, and sudden death. Clinicians must be aware of the risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome can be prevented with proper monitoring and slow, gradual initiation of feeding.

Rationale: Refeeding syndrome is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in individuals with anorexia nervosa who are undergoing refeeding, whether through enteral or parenteral nutrition. It occurs due to a shift from fat-based metabolism to carbohydrate-based metabolism, leading to a rapid decrease in phosphorus levels. This can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms. The other options are not directly related to enteral feeding in anorexia nervosa patients.",True,model6

As aortitis is a late finding, the diagnosis is tertiary syphilis.",Early primary syphilis,Late primary syphilis,Secondary syphilis,Tertiary syphilis,quatenary syphilis,D,"D. Tertiary syphilis

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, particularly the aortitis, suggest tertiary syphilis. Tertiary syphilis occurs years after the initial infection and can cause cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms.

Rationale: The lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) is a ring-like muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach. It acts as a valve, allowing food to pass into the stomach while preventing stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus. In gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the LES does not function properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.",True,model6

###Answer:",C,"Current theory holds that a reentrant arrhythmia is caused by damaged heart muscle, so that conduction is slowed through the damaged area in only one direction. A drug that prevents conduction in either direction through the damaged area interrupts the reentrant arrhythmia. Class I antiarrhythmics, such as lidocaine, are capable of producing bidirectional block.

Rationale: 
Arrhythmias resulting from a reentry focus occur when there is a unidirectional block in a part of the heart. This means that an electrical impulse can travel in one direction but not in the other. If a drug converts this unidirectional block to a bidirectional block, then the reentry loop is eliminated and the arrhythmia is suppressed.

While awaiting confirmation of the infant's HIV status, which can take several months, starting prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 6 weeks of age is generally recommended. Severe anemia may be linked with AIDS and may necessitate blood transfusion, particularly if respiratory compromise is evident. Despite attempts, bone marrow transplants in AIDS patients have been unsuccessful due to the persistent presence of the virus in macrophages throughout the body.HIV-positive and AIDS patients should undergo primary and booster immunization with vaccines such as diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) (unless severely immunocompromised), hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugated vaccine (HibCV). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is now recommended instead of oral polio vaccine (OPV) for all patients due to the theoretical risk of paralytic polio. In the event of measles exposure, HIV-infected children should receive a protective dose of measles immunoglobulin regardless of their vaccination history. Additionally, pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax) should be administered at age 2, and influenza vaccine is recommended annually.Over time, all HIV-infected individuals are likely to experience weight loss and failure to thrive due to factors such as reduced caloric intake from poor appetite, intestinal malabsorption, and increased resting energy expenditure associated with chronic infection. Despite the challenges in maintaining adequate nutrition in AIDS patients, vitamin C supplementation alone does not offer any specific benefits.

###Options:
A.  Testicular pain
B.  Back pain
C.  Frequent urination
D.  Constipation
E.  Breast tenderness

###Answer:",C,Frequent urination is a common symptom of UTIs in women due to irritation of the bladder lining by bacteria.,Testicular pain,Back pain,Frequent urination,Constipation,Breast tenderness,C,"C. Frequent urination

Rationale: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections that occur in the urinary system. In women, UTIs typically cause symptoms such as frequent urination, burning sensation while urinating, and pelvic pressure. Frequent urination is a common symptom of UTIs in women as the infection irritates the bladder and urethra, leading to a sudden and intense need to urinate.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Neutrophil
B.  Reticulocyte
C.  Platelet
D.  Eosinophil
E.  Red blood cell

###Answer:",A,"Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the body's immune response against infection. They are the first cells to arrive at the site of infection and are responsible for engulfing and destroying bacteria and other pathogens. Neutrophils release enzymes and chemicals that help to kill the invading microorganisms.

Therefore, neutrophils are the primary cell that functions in the defensive mechanism of the body during infection.",Neutrophil,Reticulocyte,Platelet,Eosinophil,Red blood cell,A,"A

Rationale: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the defense mechanism of the body against infection. They are the first line of defense against bacterial infections and are capable of phagocytosing foreign particles and bacteria. They are also involved in the production of reactive oxygen species, which helps to kill bacteria. The other options are not directly involved in the defense mechanism against infection.

When told she has a fallen uterus, she wonders if it is due to the damage from her round ligaments since she had a great deal of round ligament pain during her pregnancies. Which of the following ligaments provide the most support to the uterus in terms of preventing prolapse?
###Options:
A.  (A)	broad ligaments
B.  (B)	round ligaments
C.  (C)	utero-ovarian ligaments
D.  (D)	cardinal ligaments
E.  (E)	arcuate ligament

###Answer:",D,"The cardinal ligaments are also called the transverse cervical ligaments, or Mackenrodts ligaments, and are considered part of the uterosacral ligament complex. These ligaments serve as the major support for the apex of the vagina and are severed at the time of hysterectomy. Once divided at hysterectomy, vaginal vault prolapse becomes more likely. The broad ligaments are mainly peritoneum and the round ligaments mainly muscle. Neither provides much support. The arcuate ligament is not attached to the uterus.",(A)	broad ligaments,(B)	round ligaments,(C)	utero-ovarian ligaments,(D)	cardinal ligaments,(E)	arcuate ligament,D,"D. cardinal ligaments

Rationale: The cardinal ligaments, which are also known as the transverse cervical ligaments, provide the most support to the uterus in terms of preventing prolapse. These ligaments are condensations of pelvic fascia that originate from the cervix and insert into the lateral pelvic wall. They provide lateral support to the uterus and help to prevent uterine prolapse. The round ligaments, which the patient mentioned, do provide some support to the uterus, but they are more involved in anteversion and anteflexion of the uterus rather than preventing prolapse. The broad ligaments are simply folds of peritoneum that cover the uterus and do not provide significant support. The utero-ovarian ligaments are involved in supporting the ovaries, not the uterus. The arcuate ligament is a condensation of pelvic fascia that forms the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia, but it does not provide significant support to the uterus.",True,model6

E.  Trypanosoma brucei

###Answer:",D,"Abdominal pain, haematuria and bloody diarrhea are all symptoms of schistosomiasis. This is a protozoa which finds its host in the pancreas of freshwater snails. Chronic infection of S. haematobium leads to an increased risk of bladder cancer. Leishmaniasis most commonly takes a cutaneous form and is spread by the sandfly.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of Schistosomiasis. The patient's initial presentation with bloody diarrhoea, right upper quadrant pain and haematuria, along with hepatosplenomegaly, is consistent with acute Schistosomiasis. The patient's subsequent development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder is also consistent with chronic Schistosomiasis, as Schistosoma haematobium is a known risk factor for this type of cancer.

Rationale: The recommended method for preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is using barrier methods during intercourse. This includes using condoms, diaphragms, and other forms of barrier protection to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids during sexual activity. While abstinence from sexual activity (Option A) and monogamous relationships (Option B) can also reduce the risk of STI transmission, they may not be realistic or practical options for everyone.

###Options:
A.  Suprapubic
B.  Paramedian
C.  Median longitudinal
D.  Subcostal
E.  Grid incision

###Answer:",C,The linea alba is relatively avascular and thus will take a longer time to heal.,Suprapubic,Paramedian,Median longitudinal,Subcostal,Grid incision,E,"E. Grid incision

Rationale: Grid incision is a type of incision used for open surgical procedures, particularly for appendectomy. It is a transverse incision that is made in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. This type of incision takes longer to heal due to the following reasons:

1. **More tissue disruption**: A grid incision involves cutting through multiple layers of tissue, including skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle, which leads to more tissue disruption and a longer healing time.

2. **Poor blood supply**: The transverse orientation of the incision can lead to poor blood supply to the wound edges, which can impede the healing process.

3. **Increased risk of wound complications**: Grid incisions are associated with a higher risk of wound complications, such as wound infection, seroma, and hematoma, which can prolong the healing time.

In contrast, the other options are generally associated with faster healing times. Median longitudinal incisions (option C) are often used for midline laparotomy and have a lower risk of wound complications. Paramedian incisions (option B) are used for open surgical procedures and have a lower risk of wound infection compared to grid incisions. Subcostal incisions (option D) are used for laparoscopic procedures and are associated with minimal tissue disruption and a lower risk of wound complications.

Rationale: The patient is experiencing recurrent episodes of paralysis, which resolve with potassium administration, suggesting a diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can help reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis by reducing potassium efflux from muscle cells.

###Options:
A.  Focal injuries
B.  Viral infections
C.  Anoxic encephalopathy
D.  Stroke
E.  Dementia

###Answer:",C,"Anoxic encephalopathy typically has the worst rehab outcome among the given options. Anoxic encephalopathy refers to a condition where the brain is deprived of oxygen, leading to damage and impairment of brain function. This type of brain injury can occur due to various causes such as cardiac arrest, suffocation, or severe respiratory failure. The lack of oxygen to the brain can result in significant and widespread damage, affecting multiple areas and functions of the brain. As a result, the rehabilitation process for individuals with anoxic encephalopathy can be challenging and may have limited success in restoring normal brain function.",Focal injuries,Viral infections,Anoxic encephalopathy,Stroke,Dementia,C,"C

Rationale: Anoxic encephalopathy is a type of brain injury that results from a lack of oxygen to the brain. It often leads to severe and diffuse brain damage, which can result in poor rehabilitation outcomes. This is because anoxic encephalopathy can affect multiple areas of the brain, leading to widespread cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments. In contrast, focal injuries such as stroke or traumatic brain injury may have a more limited impact on brain function, and viral infections may have a more variable outcome depending on the specific type and severity of the infection. Dementia is a progressive condition that can have a poor outcome, but the rate of decline can vary widely depending on the underlying cause and individual factors.",True,model6

Vital signs are heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, and temperature 95.9 °F (35.5 °C ). His friends brought him in for suicidal statements. The patient is very tense and claims he is just having a bad trip and seeing things. The patient fears he might die from hearing too many colors. He is acting paranoid toward staff members. On further examination, his gait is abnormal, and he has increased muscle tone and diffuse tremors. Incidentally, his response bias scale (RBS) is 210. What substance is the patient most likely using?

C.  Alcohol
D.  Lysergic acid diethylamide
E.  cocaine

###Answer:",D,"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) acutely presents with tachycardia, high blood pressure, hypothermia, elevated RBS, dilated pupils, increased muscle tension, tremors, and gait instability.

Bizarre delusions are very common with LSD use. Most notably, there is a cross-over phenomenon of hearing colors and seeing sounds.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a hallucinogen overdose, specifically lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The patient's altered perception of colors and sounds, as well as his paranoia and abnormal gait, are all indicative of LSD use. The patient's vital signs are relatively normal, which is consistent with LSD, as it does not typically cause significant changes in vital signs. The patient's response bias scale (RBS) of 210 is also consistent with LSD use, as it indicates a high level of paranoia and suspiciousness.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"The clitoris consists of two crura, a short body, and the glans clitoris with overlying skin called the prepuce. It is attached to the pubic bone by a suspensory ligament. Within the shaft are corpora cavernosa consisting of erectile tissue (loose in structure) that engorges with blood, causing erection and enlargement (two times usual size) during sexual excitement. The clitoris and prepuce are the primary areas of erotic stimulation in most women.

###Options:
A.  Intussusception
B.  Meconium ileus
C.  Hirschsprungs disease
D.  Meckels diverticulum
E.  Incarcerated hernia

###Answer:",B,"The correct options for typical causes of neonatal intestinal obstruction are:

b. Meconium ileus: Meconium ileus is a condition characterized by thickened meconium obstructing the terminal ileum, typically occurring in infants with cystic fibrosis.

c. Hirschsprung's disease: Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction.

e. Incarcerated hernia: An incarcerated hernia occurs when a loop of intestine becomes trapped in the hernia sac, leading to obstruction of the bowel.

Intussusception (option a) is not a typical cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction. It commonly occurs in older infants and children.

Meckel's diverticulum (option d) is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract but is not a common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction.

Rationale: Neonatal intestinal obstruction is typically caused by congenital anomalies or conditions that occur in the perinatal period. Meconium ileus, which is a type of intestinal obstruction caused by an impaction of thick meconium in the small intestine, is a common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction. It is often associated with cystic fibrosis.

Intussusception (Option A) typically occurs in older infants and toddlers. Hirschsprung's disease (Option C) can cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, but it is not as common as meconium ileus. Meckel's diverticulum (Option D) is a congenital anomaly that can cause intestinal obstruction, but it typically presents later in childhood.

###Options:
A.  Enalapril
B.  Losartan
C.  Nifedipine
D.  Prazosin
E.  Propranolol

###Answer:",A,"The cough is most likely an adverse effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril. Losartan is an ARB that has the same beneficial effects as an ACE inhibitor but is less likely to produce a cough. Nifedipine, prazosin, and propranolol do not cause this side effect.",Enalapril,Losartan,Nifedipine,Prazosin,Propranolol,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are most likely caused by enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a dry, persistent cough in some patients, which is thought to be due to the inhibition of bradykinin breakdown, leading to increased levels of this peptide. Bradykinin is a potent stimulator of cough receptors. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker, which does not affect bradykinin levels and is therefore less likely to cause cough. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, prazosin is an alpha blocker, and propranolol is a beta blocker, none of which are typically associated with cough as a side effect.",True,model6

Rationale: 
The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is a hallmark of atrial fibrillation. The absence of P waves and the presence of a narrow QRS complex (less than 120 ms) also support this diagnosis. In atrial tachycardia, P waves are usually visible, and the rhythm is regular. Atrial flutter typically shows a sawtooth pattern in the inferior leads, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Ventricular tachycardia would have a wide QRS complex (more than 120 ms). Supraventricular tachycardia can have a narrow QRS complex, but the rhythm is usually regular, not irregularly irregular.",True,model6

A.  Chemical dissolution of the gallstone
B.  Lithotripsy
C.  Open cholecystectomy
D.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

###Answer:",D,"Given the diagnosis of bile duct obstruction in a patient with a history of liver disease, the appropriate procedure to address this condition would be laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Rationale: 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the recommended treatment for bile duct obstruction in a patient with a history of liver disease. This is because laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that reduces the risk of complications, especially in patients with underlying liver disease. It also allows for faster recovery and reduces the risk of postoperative complications. Chemical dissolution of the gallstone (Option A) is not a suitable option as it is not effective in removing the obstruction.

She has recently given birth to a healthy baby boy and is enjoying being a mother. However, she is becoming more reliant on her partner for support as she always feels exhausted and often becomes depressed. The patient has a poor appetite and often does not finish her meals, despite this she has gained 5 kg in the last 2 weeks. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Postpartum depression
B.  Eating disorder
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Occult malignancy

###Answer:",D,"Hypothyroidism (D) is a common disease with a higher prevalence in females and is usually a primary disorder affecting the thyroid gland itself. Thyroid hormones control the metabolic rate in many tissues, underactivity produces symptoms which are often insidious. These include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. The main causes include iodine deficiency, autoimmune pathology such as Hashimotos thyroiditis and, in females who have recently given birth, postpartum thyroiditis. Hyperthryoidism (C) results in an excess of thyroid hormones which inappropriately increases metabolic rate with symptoms such as weight loss, increased sweating, restlessness and palpitations. A goitre can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Postpartum depression (A) is often accompanied by confusion and is characterized by low mood, anhedonia and anergia. Severely affected patients can have delusional thoughts about their newborn child, such as it being evil, and even progress to thoughts of harming the child or suicidal ideation. Eating disorders (B), such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa, often result in drastic changes in body weight resulting from psychological problems with self-image and include behaviours such as self-induced vomiting to avoid weight gain or binge eating.

###Answer:",D,"Two drugs among the choices that could relieve asthma are ephedrine and salmeterol, as they activate ²2 receptors in the bronchioles and cause bronchodilation. However, salmeterol is a selective ²2 agonist and should not cause an increase in blood pressure. Ephedrine on the other hand stimulates the release of norepinephrine and acts as a direct agonist at ±- and ²-adrenergic receptors, thus causing an increase in blood pressure. Phenylephrine (a nonselective ± agonist) does not cause bronchodilation. Norepinephrine is a nonselective adrenergic agonist that does not have any stimulatory effects on ²2 receptors. Also, norepinephrine is not active when given orally",Phenylephrine,Norepinephrine,Dobutamine,Ephedrine,Salmeterol,D,"D. Ephedrine

Rationale: The patient's blood pressure is increasing despite being on a ²1-selective blocker, which suggests that the herbal remedy contains a sympathomimetic agent that is stimulating the ²2 receptors in the lungs, thereby relieving asthma attacks. The increase in blood pressure suggests that this agent is also stimulating ± receptors. Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates both ²2 and ± receptors, which fits the patient's symptoms. Phenylephrine is an ±1 agonist that would increase blood pressure but would not relieve asthma attacks. Norepinephrine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates both ± and ²1 receptors, but it would not relieve asthma attacks.

The best next step in treatment would be to administer phenoxybenzamine (alpha-adrenergic blocker). After adequate alpha-blockade, the patient should be administered a beta-adrenergic blocker in order to prepare the patient for surgery via laparoscopic tumor resection (adrenalectomy).",Surgical removal,Administration of alpha-adrenergic blockade,Administration of beta-adrenergic blockade,Administration of alpha-beta-adrenergic blockade,,D,"D. Administration of alpha-beta-adrenergic blockade

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines. The patient's history of hypertension, headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's initial high blood pressure followed by a lower reading on the second measurement is also consistent with this diagnosis, as patients with pheochromocytoma often have labile blood pressure. The patient's use of testosterone supplements may also be related to the development of this tumor. The best initial therapy for this patient would be the administration of alpha-beta-adrenergic blockade to control the symptoms of catecholamine excess. Phenoxybenzamine, a non-selective alpha blocker, is often used for this purpose. Beta blockers should not be used initially, as they can cause unopposed alpha stimulation, leading to further vasoconstriction and worsening of hypertension. Surgery is not the initial therapy, but rather a later step in the management of this patient after alpha-beta blockade has been achieved.",False,model6

###Options:
A.  Polycythemia rubra vera
B.  Vasculitis
C.  Philadelphia chromosome negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
D.  Primary myofibrosis (PMF)
E.  Essential thrombocythemia

###Answer:",E,"Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described, the most likely diagnosis is essential thrombocythemia (ET).Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, leading to thrombocytosis. Patients with ET may present with symptoms related to thrombosis or bleeding, as well as symptoms related to the underlying disease process. In this case, the patient presents with severe arterial insufficiency of the right second toe, which could be attributed to thrombosis associated with elevated platelet counts.The laboratory findings of elevated platelet count (1300 x 10^9/L) support the diagnosis of ET. Additionally, the absence of significant past medical history and the presence of splenomegaly are consistent with ET.Other differential diagnoses may include polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), but the normal hemoglobin level (Hb of 13.5) and absence of erythrocytosis make PRV less likely. Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) typically presents with marked leukocytosis, which is not evident in this case. Primary myofibrosis (PMF) would typically present with more prominent constitutional symptoms and bone marrow fibrosis, which are not described in the case.",Polycythemia rubra vera,Vasculitis,Philadelphia chromosome negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML),Primary myofibrosis (PMF),Essential thrombocythemia,E,"E.

Rationale: Septicemia in a neonate is suspected when there are signs of infection in the first week of life. The following are some of the features that are compatible with the diagnosis of neonatal septicemia in a 1-week-old neonate:

* Bulging anterior fontanelle (option B): This is a sign of meningitis, which is a complication of septicemia.
* Respiratory distress (option C): This can be a presenting feature of septicemia in a neonate.

The other options are not correct because:

* PROM (premature rupture of membranes) for 48 hours in the mother (option A) is a risk factor for septicemia, but it is not a feature of the disease in the neonate.
* An absolute WBC count of 10,000/mm3 (option D) is not a specific feature of septicemia, as it can be seen in other conditions as well.
* An immature neutrophil count of 10% (option E) is not a specific feature of septicemia. In fact, an immature neutrophil count of more than 20% is suggestive of septicemia.",False,model6

Rationale: The earliest indicator of response to iron therapy in a patient with iron deficiency anemia is an increase in reticulocyte count, which typically occurs within 7-10 days of starting treatment. This is because iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis, and when iron becomes available, the bone marrow rapidly produces new red blood cells, leading to an increase in reticulocytes. The other options are not correct because: 
- Hemoglobin levels may take several weeks to increase (option B).
- Ferritin levels may actually decrease initially as iron is mobilized from storage sites to meet the demands of hemoglobin synthesis (option C).
- Serum iron levels may fluctuate and do not necessarily reflect the body's iron stores (option D).",True,model6

Which of the following is the most likely complication to develop in the patient?
###Options:
A.  Lactic acidosis
B.  Septic shock
C.  Psueodocyst
D.  Renal failure
E.  hyperurucemia

###Answer:",C,"The vignette represents a classical presentation of acute pancreatitis with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back and is associated with nausea and vomiting which is relieved by bending forward. Elevation in serum lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pathophysiology of pancreatitis involves both the localized destruction in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response. The inciting event is the premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the acinar cell.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is defined by the Revised Atlanta Classification and requires at least 2 of 3 criteria be met: 1) a lipase or amylase level that is three times the upper limit of normal 2) abdominal pain that is consistent with pancreatitis 3) abdominal imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. A pseudocyst, the most likely complication, is a walled-off fluid collection seen after 4 weeks of an acute episode.

Management for acute pancreatitis includes early aggressive fluid resuscitation and nutrition. Mortality is 1% to 2%. Most of thee pseudocysts resolve with observation alone with periodic follow-up using CT or MRI. Drainage is only recommended in symptomatic, infected or rapidly enlarging pseudocysts.

Peritonitis can be seen in the setting of bowel or gastric perforation.",Lactic acidosis,Septic shock,Psueodocyst,Renal failure,hyperurucemia,D,"D

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms and signs of pancreatitis, likely due to the history of alcohol consumption.

Upon examination, jaundice is noted without the presence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Full blood examination (FBE) shows hemoglobin levels at 80 g/L (reference range [RR] 115165) with a mean cell volume of 101 fL (RR 8098), while white cell count and platelets remain within normal ranges. Blood film analysis indicates the presence of spherocytes and polychromasia, with coagulation tests yielding normal results. Notably, she recently returned from a trip to India where she adhered to malarial prophylaxis. Interestingly, a previous FBE conducted five years ago displayed entirely normal results. Among the following statements, the most accurate one is:
###Options:
A.  A direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also known as a direct Coombs test) should be performed.
B.  The presence of anemia and the history of a trip to India makes autoimmune hemolytic anemia a consideration despite prophylaxis.
C.  Presence of spherocytes and polychromasia suggests an ongoing hemolytic process rather than reticulocytopenia.
D.  Drug-induced hemolysis secondary to malaria prophylaxis is most likely.
E.  The most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis.

###Answer:",A,"The most probable diagnosis is autoimmune hemolytic anemia, supported by the presence of spherocytes and polychromasia. Confirmation through a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) would reveal immunoglobulin or complement proteins adherent on red blood cell surfaces. Hereditary spherocytosis is less likely given the normal findings in the full blood examination (FBE) conducted previously. Oxidative hemolysis typically presents with 'bite cells' on blood film. Reticulocytosis, as indicated by polychromasia, is an anticipated finding in autoimmune hemolysis. Malaria is improbable, especially if appropriate prophylactic measures were taken, and fever is absent. In the context of autoimmune hemolysis, reticulocytosis rather than reticulocytopenia is expected.","A direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also known as a direct Coombs test) should be performed.",The presence of anemia and the history of a trip to India makes autoimmune hemolytic anemia a consideration despite prophylaxis.,Presence of spherocytes and polychromasia suggests an ongoing hemolytic process rather than reticulocytopenia.,Drug-induced hemolysis secondary to malaria prophylaxis is most likely.,The most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis.,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an ongoing hemolytic process. The presence of spherocytes and polychromasia (reticulocytosis) indicates an active hemolytic process. The recent travel to India does not seem to be related to the diagnosis, as the patient adhered to malarial prophylaxis. The normal white cell count and platelets rule out lymphoproliferative disorders, and the absence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly makes lymphoma less likely. The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which is supported by the presence of spherocytes and polychromasia. Therefore, a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",True,model6

B.  Cell-surface phenotyping.
C.  Lumbar puncture
D.  Cytogenetic testing.
E.  Plasma viscosity.

###Answer:",E,"Viscosity testing is typically employed in cases of multiple myeloma, where paraproteins, especially immunoglobulin M, can cause vascular sludging leading to tissue ischemia. For acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), routine chemistry tests are recommended to assess for end-organ abnormalities in organs like the kidney and liver. A lumbar puncture is essential in newly diagnosed ALL cases to rule out central nervous system involvement. Bone marrow biopsy is often necessary to determine the extent of marrow infiltration and assist in tumor classification. Immunologic cell-surface marker testing helps identify the cell lineage and tumor type, which may not be discernible through morphologic interpretation alone. Additionally, cytogenetic testing provides prognostic insights into the disease's natural history. Prognosis in ALL depends on various factors including tumor genetics, patient age, white blood cell count, and overall clinical status alongside major organ function.",Bone marrow biopsy,Cell-surface phenotyping.,Lumbar puncture,Cytogenetic testing.,Plasma viscosity.,E,"E

Rationale: Plasma viscosity is not a routine evaluation for a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia. The other options are all part of the routine evaluation.

###Answer:",D,"The most effective approach once the index ulcer has healed in a patient with an NSAID-related gastric ulcer complicated by UGI bleeding and a positive H. pylori test is to eradicate H. pylori, shift to a COX-2 selective NSAID, and continue maintenance PPI. This approach addresses both the underlying cause of the ulcer (H. pylori infection) and minimizes the risk of further gastric ulceration by switching to a COX-2 selective NSAID, which has a lower risk of gastrointestinal complications compared to non-selective NSAIDs. Maintenance PPI therapy is also important to further reduce the risk of recurrent ulcers.","Eradicate H. pylori, continue previous NSAID, maintenance PPI","Eradicate H. pylori, shift to a  COX-2 selective NSAID",PPI maintenance therapy,"Eradicate H. pylori, shift to a COX-2 selective NSAID, maintenance PPI",None of the above,D,"D

Rationale: The patient requires continued NSAID treatment, has a history of gastric ulcer complicated by UGI bleeding, and is H. pylori positive. Eradicating H. pylori and shifting to a COX-2 selective NSAID reduces the risk of recurrent ulceration and bleeding. However, even with a COX-2 selective NSAID, there is still a risk of recurrent ulceration and bleeding.

",Subtotal thyroidectomy,Cholecystectomy,Prostatectomy,Sigmoidectomy,Appendicectomy,A,"A
Rationale: The infection rates are high in wounds contaminated with bacteria, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract. The risk of wound infection is high in sigmoidectomy (colorectal surgery) and appendicectomy (appendix is a part of the gut). Cholecystectomy involves opening the gallbladder which is connected to the gut, so there is a risk of bacterial contamination. Prostatectomy involves opening the urinary tract, which is also contaminated with bacteria.

His medical history is significant for alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed 1 year ago but he refused to implement any lifestyle changes. Vital signs are blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 110 bpm, temperature 37° C (98.6° F), and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. On physical examination, the abdomen is non-tender and distended. The fluid thrill and shifting dullness tests are positive. Laboratory testing shows hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, a blood urea nitrogen level of 20 mg/dL (upper limit of normal 26 mg/dL), creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.1. An upper GI endoscopy is performed to further evaluate the etiology of hematemesis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Liver failure
B.  Heart failure
C.  Portal Hypertension
D.  Encephalopath
E.  Renal failure

###Answer:",C,"This patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and alcoholic fatty liver disease. The continued use of alcohol most likely damaged his liver to the point of cirrhosis, causing portal hypertension.

Portal hypertension causes excessive amounts of blood to be shunted through the portosystemic shunts.

One shunt exists through the submucosal veins of the esophagus. In the situation of portal hypertension, these submucosal veins dilate and are at risk of rupture. In this patient, the most likely etiology of the hematemesis is esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension.

Liver failure, heart failure, and encephalopathy would not be causes for hematemesis in this patient. Although in the context of liver failure portal hypertension could be present, the better option would be portal hypertension itself as it is the direct cause of esophageal varices.",Liver failure,Heart failure,Portal Hypertension,Encephalopath,Renal failure,C,"C. Portal Hypertension

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms of bloody vomiting, abdominal distension, and fluid thrill and shifting dullness on physical examination suggest the presence of ascites. The absence of tenderness on abdominal examination makes liver failure or acute hepatitis less likely. The patient's history of alcoholic fatty liver disease and the presence of ascites suggest portal hypertension as the underlying etiology. Portal hypertension is a common complication of liver cirrhosis and can lead to the development of varices, which can cause bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic instability and bloody vomiting further support this diagnosis.",True,model6

You tell him that there is a chance that he might develop the disease when he is older and that you are going to start regular monitoring to identify early manifestations of the disease. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate first screening test?

###Options:
A.  Hepatic iron concentration
B.  haemoglobin
C.  Serum transferring saturation

E.  Serum transferring saturation

###Answer:",E,Transferrin concentration measures the amount of iron bound to transferrin protein,Hepatic iron concentration,haemoglobin,Serum transferring saturation,Total iron-binding capacity,Serum transferring saturation,C,"C. Serum transferring saturation

Rationale: Haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive absorption of dietary iron, leading to iron overload and tissue damage. The most appropriate first screening test for haemochromatosis is serum transferrin saturation. Transferrin saturation is a measure of the amount of iron bound to transferrin, a protein that carries iron in the blood. In haemochromatosis, the amount of iron bound to transferrin is increased, resulting in an elevated transferrin saturation. This test is a sensitive and specific screening test for haemochromatosis, and an elevated level can be followed up with further testing, such as genetic testing or liver biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis.",False,model6

He has a past medical history significant for wellcontrolled hypertension, and his gallbladder was removed 3 years ago in the setting of acute cholecystitis. He does not smoke and drinks one to two alcoholic beverages per day. Family history is remarkable for colon cancer in his mother at age 45 and a brother at age 49. He has a sister who developed endometrial cancer at age 53 .He has never undergone colon cancer screening and is interested in pursuing this.  Which colorectal cancer screening test would be best for this patient?
###Options:
A.  Virtual colonoscopy
B.  Barium enema alone
C.  Barium enema with flexible sigmoidoscopy
D.  fecak ocult blood testing 3 times
E.  colonoscopy

###Answer:",E,"The patient should undergo screening colonoscopy, especially with his strongly positive family history of first-degree relatives developing colon cancer before age 50. Colonoscopy is the only test that can directly evaluate the entire colon and rectum. Most polyps can be removed completely at colonoscopy, and large lesions or masses can be directly biopsied. Virtual colonoscopy and barium enema combined with flexible sigmoidoscopy are good tests, but any positive findings on either of these tests would warrant further examination with colonoscopy. Barium enema alone is insufficient for screening. Fecal occult blood testing is helpful as a screening tool, but would be inadequate alone in this patient given his family history. The patient satisfies criteria for HNPCC, a syndrome seen in patients with germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. He has three first-degree relatives with cancer of the colorectum, endometrium, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis (all of whom are first-degree relatives of each other). The colorectal cancers involve at least two  generations and at least one case was diagnosed before age 50.

A.  Sepsis
B.  Hyperventilation
C.  Dehydration
D.  Iatrogenic
E.  panic attack

###Answer:",B,"Although Trousseau's sign is most commonly seen in hypocalcemia, hyperventilation can cause carpopedal spasms.

Hyperventilation can cause the body to become alkalotic via the exhalation of carbon dioxide.

In metabolic alkalosis, calcium is more readily bound to albumin, thus decreasing the amount of free-ionized calcium in the blood. In exchange for the calcium, albumin releases its bound hydrogen ion.

Although hypocalcemia is present in sepsis, this patient who is afebrile and has a history of panic attacks is more likely to be having carpopedal spasms in the setting of hyperventilation.",Sepsis,Hyperventilation,Dehydration,Iatrogenic,panic attack,B,"B. Hyperventilation

Rationale: The patient's symptoms, such as heart racing, rapid breathing, and panic attack, are consistent with hyperventilation. The observation of hand spasms, also known as carpopedal spasm, is a classic sign of hyperventilation. This occurs due to the low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, which causes an increase in pH and leads to muscle spasms.

E.  Weight loss

###Answer:",B,Ref: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Page 920) Davidsons  Principles and Practice of Medicine,Anaemia,Abdominal pain relieved by defecation,Blood in stools,Nocturnal symptoms,Weight loss,B,"B

Rationale: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. The symptoms of IBS are often relieved by defecation, which is a key feature distinguishing it from other conditions. In contrast, anaemia, blood in stools, nocturnal symptoms, and weight loss are not typical features of IBS and may suggest other underlying conditions.",True,model6

The pain has been occurring intermittently for 3 days. It is not associated with exertion, does not radiate, and is ""dull"" in nature. The physical exam is remarkable for obesity and lower extremity edema. The cardiac exam is normal. Your senior registrar asked you to perfrom an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has had several prior ECGs in the past as seen in the documentation in his hospital folder. They all showed LBBB similar to the present one. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Call a cardiac alert so the patient can receive an immediate percutaneous coronary intervention
B.  Have the patient bear down and repeat the ECG
C.  Administer a loading dose of amiodarone to the patient and repeat the ECG
D.  Check a serum troponin
E.  repeat the ECG after a few hours

###Answer:",D,"The patient's left bundle branch block (LBBB) is not new; therefore, it is not an ST-segment elevation equivalent. ECGs showing LBBB do not have interpretable ST-T wave segments and there is no mention in this case regarding any positive Sgarbossa criteria. The patient has not been ruled in for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), therefore, calling a cardiac alert is not indicated.

LBBB, once present, is usually permanent. This patient has proven as much with his prior ECGs all showing LBBB. There is no clinical maneuver that can reverse LBBB.

There is no medical therapy that would reverse a left bundle branch block. Amiodarone is not indicated.

Checking a serum troponin is indicated in patients presenting with chest pain. For this patient to rule in for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) he has to meet two of three criteria: chest pain, ST-elevation on ECG, and elevated troponin. The patient presently meets only one of these criteria, and his ECG's ST segments are uninterpretable due to his LBBB. A negative serum troponin would rule out NSTEMI. Serum troponin can rule in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or provide prognostic information for patients with ACS.",Call a cardiac alert so the patient can receive an immediate percutaneous coronary intervention,Have the patient bear down and repeat the ECG,Administer a loading dose of amiodarone to the patient and repeat the ECG,Check a serum troponin,repeat the ECG after a few hours,D,"D. Check a serum troponin

Rationale: 
The patient presents with chest pain, which is a concerning symptom. However, the pain is not typical of cardiac pain and the ECG shows a pre-existing LBBB. The presence of LBBB can make it difficult to diagnose a myocardial infarction (MI) using ECG criteria. Therefore, the best next step is to check a serum troponin level, which is a more sensitive and specific marker for cardiac injury. This will help to determine if the patient has had a myocardial infarction. The other options are not correct because the patient does not meet the criteria for a cardiac alert, repeating the ECG after a few hours will not provide any additional information, and administering amiodarone is not indicated in this scenario.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Baroreceptors are pressure sensors located at  various cardiovascular sites.
B.  The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden drop in blood pressure
C.  The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden increase in blood  pressure.
D.  The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in  response to a sudden drop in blood pressure
E.  The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.

###Answer:",B,"When there is a sudden drop in blood pressure, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain, and the brain activates the sympathetic system (not the parasympathetic system) to restore blood pressure to normal values.",Baroreceptors are pressure sensors located at  various cardiovascular sites.,The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden drop in blood pressure,The parasympathetic system is activated by the  CNS in response to a sudden increase in blood  pressure.,The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in  response to a sudden drop in blood pressure,"The parasympathetic division is involved in  accommodation of near vision, movement of food,  and urination.",B,"B

Rationale: The sympathetic system is activated by the CNS in response to a sudden drop in blood pressure, not the parasympathetic system. The sympathetic system helps to increase blood pressure by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction, whereas the parasympathetic system has a more prominent role in decreasing blood pressure.

###Options:
A.  Stabilize blood pressure first, then proceed with investigations including MRI of the brain, blood culture, and CSF analyses.
B.  Obtaining an MRI scan can consume valuable time. Once blood pressure is stabilized, prioritize obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses for diagnostic purposes.
C.  Obtain blood cultures, treat with intravenous antibiotics, maintain  blood pressure, and then initate investigations
D.  Investigate with an MRI brain scan and CSF analysis, and then treat  for viral or bacterial meningitis depending on results.

###Answer:",C,"The patient is likely suffering from meningococcal meningitis, which is an aggressive condition requiring immediate treatment to prevent fatal outcomes. While enteroviruses can cause a skin rash, they do not typically lead to hemorrhagic lesions. This clinical presentation is also known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, and the drop in blood pressure may be attributed to adrenal gland bleeding.","Stabilize blood pressure first, then proceed with investigations including MRI of the brain, blood culture, and CSF analyses.","Obtaining an MRI scan can consume valuable time.

Obtain blood cultures, treat with intravenous antibiotics, maintain  blood pressure, and then initiate investigations

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of meningococcal septicemia, which is a medical emergency. The priority is to stabilize the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure, and initiate antibiotic therapy as soon as possible.

C.  Perform an exploratory laparotomy
D.  Refer to a trauma center
E.  Observe and monitor the patient's condition

###Answer:",C,"In the case of a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which can cause life-threatening internal injuries, the most appropriate initial management in an African setting is to perform an exploratory laparotomy to identify and address any internal bleeding or organ damage, rather than relying on advanced imaging techniques that may not be readily available.",Administer intravenous fluids and antibiotics,Obtain a CT scan of the abdomen,Perform an exploratory laparotomy,Refer to a trauma center,Observe and monitor the patient's condition,C,"C.

Rationale: 
Patients with gunshot wounds to the abdomen typically require immediate surgical exploration due to the high risk of intra-abdominal injuries. The initial management should focus on stabilizing the patient and performing an exploratory laparotomy to identify and repair any injuries. While antibiotics and intravenous fluids may be administered, they should not delay the surgical intervention.

Rationale: The patient is a healthy young woman with a normal pregnancy at 8 weeks and 3 days gestation. She has no complaints or issues and is taking prenatal vitamins. The best initial step in this patient's care is reassurance. There is no indication for further testing or intervention at this time. A transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound may be performed to confirm the gestational age and fetal viability, but this is not necessary in this patient.

Rationale: The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland located in the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. It produces the hormone melatonin, which promotes sleepiness and is released in response to darkness. The pineal gland receives signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master clock that regulates the body's circadian rhythm, and responds by producing melatonin in a rhythmic manner.

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is:

C. Presence of a transition zone.

In Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, a transition zone is typically observed on contrast studies such as barium enema or contrast enema. This transition zone represents the area between the aganglionic (affected) segment of the colon and the normal, ganglion cell-containing portion.

In contrast, congenital megacolon, also known as colonic dilation or congenital colonic dilatation, typically presents with generalized dilatation of the colon without a distinct transition zone. Therefore, the presence of a transition zone helps to distinguish Hirschsprung's disease from congenital megacolon on imaging studies.





",Delayed evacuation of barium,Air fluid levels,Presence of a transition zone,Dilated bowel loops,,C,"C. Presence of a transition zone

Rationale: Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal part of the colon, leading to a functional obstruction. The transition zone is the area where the normal colon meets the aganglionic segment, and it is typically narrowed and constricted. This zone is not seen in congenital megacolon.

###Options:
A.  Rathke's pouch
B.  Thymus
C.  Wolffian duct
D.  Thyroglossal duct
E.  Mullerian duct

Rationale: The thyroglossal duct is a temporary embryological structure that forms during the development of the thyroid gland. It arises from the foramen cecum, a depression in the tongue, and extends downward through the neck, eventually giving rise to the thyroid gland. During its descent, the thyroglossal duct normally disappears, leaving behind the thyroid gland in its normal location. However, in some cases, remnants of the thyroglossal duct can persist and give rise to ectopic thyroid tissue, which can be located anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of factor XIII deficiency. The patient has a history of bleeding from the umbilical stump at birth, which is a characteristic feature of factor XIII deficiency. The normal coagulation profile and platelet function tests rule out platelet disorders and other coagulation factor deficiencies. The positive urea clot lysis test suggests that the patient's blood clots are unstable and can be easily lysed, which is consistent with factor XIII deficiency. Factor XIII is responsible for stabilizing blood clots by cross-linking fibrin molecules.

Microscopic examination reveals a treelike growth pattern with a mantle characterized by significant acanthosis and parakeratosis. Treatment options include local excision, cryosurgery, application of podophyllin or trichloroacetic acid, and laser therapy. However, podophyllum is not recommended for extensive disease due to its toxicity, which can cause peripheral neuropathy. For refractory condyloma of the vagina, 5-fluorouracil can be used. Medical treatments such as podophyllum, imiquimod, trichloroacetic acid, and 5-fluorouracil require weeks or months of therapy to achieve effectiveness.

Rationale: The symptoms described are consistent with a diagnosis of condyloma acuminata, a type of genital wart caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The large size of the lesions, the presence of bleeding, and the need for a definitive diagnosis suggest that local excision is the best course of treatment. This approach allows for a thorough removal of the lesions, as well as a histopathologic evaluation to rule out any other conditions, such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer.

Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen and jaundice. Total bilirubin despite treatment is 18 mg/dL with less than 15% direct. What is the next step in the management of this condition?
###Options:
A.  Phenobarbital
B.  Phenytoin
C.  Acetaminophen
D.  Multivitamins
E.  steroids

###Answer:",A,"In most cases of mild neonatal jaundice, no treatment is necessary, and it resolves on its own within a few weeks. In cases of moderate or severe jaundice (TB over 15 mg/dL), phototherapy is a safe option.

Phenobarbital increases both the conjugation and excretion of bilirubin by stimulating the gene for the UGT1A1 enzyme that induces the production of conjugated bilirubin and thereby reduces serum bilirubin levels by 25%.

Patients with Crigler-Najjar type II syndrome do not require any treatment and can have management with phenobarbital. Also, for Gilbert syndrome, no medical therapy is needed, and phenobarbital has been effectively shown to decrease bilirubin levels.

The common medications used for the treatment of patients with Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome are phenobarbital, calcium (infusions), ursodeoxycholic acid, metalloporphyrins, chlorpromazine, and cholestyramine.",Phenobarbital,Phenytoin,Acetaminophen,Multivitamins,steroids,A,"A

Rationale: The patient is a 15-day-old infant with jaundice that started on the fourth day of life and has not improved with phototherapy. The presence of a family history of liver disease in a sibling suggests an inherited disorder. The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, but the direct bilirubin is less than 15%, indicating indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The most likely diagnosis is Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a complete deficiency of the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT1A1).

D.  Presence of granulomas in the lung
E.  gene Xpert

###Answer:",B,"There is a lot of controversy on the use of the Mantoux test in people who have already been immunized with BCG.

The interferon test relies on T cells releasing interferon when exposed to specific antigens.

This may help avoid false positives and unnecessary drug therapy.

Interferon-gamma release assay

Rationale: The BCG vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine used in many countries to prevent tuberculosis. However, it can also cause a false-positive reaction to the Mantoux test, which is a skin test used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. To avoid false-positive results, an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) can be used instead of the Mantoux test. IGRAs measure the release of interferon-gamma by T-cells in response to specific antigens of M. tuberculosis. They are more specific than the Mantoux test and are not affected by prior BCG vaccination.",True,model6

She states that she has opened her bowels 11 times since her onset of symptoms. Associated symptoms include nausea and vomiting with abdominal cramps and pain which started in the evening following a barbeque meal in the afternoon that day. The patient is alert and orientated and her observations include a pulse rate of 69, blood pressure of 124/75 and temperature of 37.1°C. On examination, her abdomen is soft, there is marked tenderness in the epigastric region and bowel sounds are hyperactive. The patient is normally fit and well with no past medical history.

B.  Gastroenteritis
C.  Ulcerative colitis
D.  Laxative abuse
E.  Crohns disease

###Answer:",B,"The history of the acute onset of diarrhoea coupled with nausea and vomiting a few hours after a meal is highly suggestive of a clinical diagnosis of gastroenteritis (B). Irritable bowel syndrome (A) sufferers usually experience chronic diarrhoea alternating with constipation. There is no history of blood-stained or mucus-based diarrhoea, which is usually seen in inflammatory bowel disease (C and E) (ulcerative/Crohns colitis). With regard to the clinical scenario, the patient has no past medical history which therefore makes laxative abuse (D) very unlikely.",Irritable bowel syndrome,Gastroenteritis,Ulcerative colitis,Laxative abuse,Crohns disease,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient presents with a sudden onset of watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps following a barbeque meal, which suggests a diagnosis of food poisoning or gastroenteritis. The patient is alert and orientated, and her observations are stable, which suggests that she is not severely dehydrated. The marked tenderness in the epigastric region and hyperactive bowel sounds support this diagnosis. The patient has no past medical history and no features of inflammatory bowel disease, which makes options C and E less likely.

###Options:
A.  Filtration
B.  Centrifugation
C.  Electrophoresis
D.  Chromatography

Rationale: Centrifugation is the most common method used to separate blood components for transfusion. This is because centrifugation is a gentle and efficient method that separates blood components based on their density. Whole blood is centrifuged to separate it into three main components: plasma, buffy coat (containing white blood cells and platelets), and red blood cells. Each component can then be further separated and processed for transfusion. While filtration, electrophoresis, chromatography, and precipitation are all laboratory techniques used to separate and purify biological molecules, they are not typically used to separate blood components for transfusion.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"Sub-Saharan African countries have a high preterm birth rate: 23.7% 

Causes of preterm delivery range from cervical incompetence, multiple gestations, uterine anomalies, or infection.

The biggest worry with preterm delivery is that infants born at <36 weeks of gestation usually have respiratory distress.

Respiratory distress in a premature infant.

Rationale: 
The biggest problem with inducing preterm labor is the risk of respiratory distress in the premature infant. At 31 weeks gestation, the lungs are not fully developed, and the baby may not be able to breathe properly after birth, leading to respiratory distress syndrome. This is a major concern and may require neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and mechanical ventilation.",True,model6

The radial nerve passes in the radial groove posterior to the mid-shaft of the humerus.

Wrist drop and weakness of all arm's extensor muscles can result from such a lesion.

Which of the following physical findings would warrant further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Lid lag
B.  Hyperacusis
C.  Epiphora
D.  Blepharoptosis
E.  Dysgeusia

###Answer:",D,"In addition to sudden-onset hemifacial paralysis, Bell palsy is often associated with dull postauricular pain (50% of patients), excessive tearing, dry eye, pain with loud sounds, and altered taste sensation.

Epiphora in Bell palsy may be due to the following: failure of the lacrimal pump mechanism from denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle, increased tear production due to exposure keratopathy from paralytic lagophthalmos, and malposition of the lacrimal punctum and failure of tear drainage due to paralytic ectropion. Despite the epiphora, however, many patients will simultaneously report dry eye because of their inability to close it completely as a result of the Bell palsy.

Hyperacusis, or pain with loud sounds, and dysgeusia result from dysfunction of intratemporal branches of the facial nerve. If the stapedius muscle is denervated, patients lack the ability to dampen stapes movement in the presence of loud sounds, making them uncomfortable. The chorda tympani nerve, which conveys taste sensation from the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue, is also a branch of the facial nerve and often functions abnormally in patients with Bell palsy.

Patients with Bell palsy do not have blepharoptosis because Bell palsy is a dysfunction of the facial nerve, which controls the orbicularis oculi muscle, among others. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye; thus, patients with Bell palsy have paralytic lagophthalmos (difficulty closing the eye), not a droopy eyelid. The muscle that opens the eye, the levator palpebrae superioris, is controlled by the oculomotor nerve, which is unaffected in Bell palsy.",Lid lag,Hyperacusis,Epiphora,Blepharoptosis,Dysgeusia,D,"D. Blepharoptosis

Rationale: 
The patient in this scenario has been diagnosed with Bell palsy and is being treated with prednisone and valacyclovir. However, there is no improvement in his symptoms. The physical findings that would warrant further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis are those that are not consistent with Bell palsy. Bell palsy is a peripheral facial nerve disorder that typically presents with unilateral facial weakness or paralysis, often accompanied by symptoms such as hyperacusis, epiphora, and dysgeusia. Lid lag, which is a characteristic of Graves' disease, is not typically seen in Bell palsy. Blepharoptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, is not a typical feature of Bell palsy and would suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as a central nervous system disorder or a neuromuscular junction disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Blepharoptosis.",True,model6

Rationale: The presence of a non expansile cough impulse is a positive test for an inguinal hernia. This test is done by asking the patient to cough while the examiner's finger is on the scrotum. If the cough impulse is felt, it suggests that the swelling is connected to the abdomen and is likely an inguinal hernia.

Rationale: 
The patient presents with chest pain and breathlessness, but the examination is unremarkable. The ECG shows pan-anterior T wave inversion, which is not typical of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The troponin is mildly elevated, but this could be due to cardiac inflammation rather than an ACS. The patient's symptoms and ECG changes are more consistent with myocarditis.

You advise your colleague that:
###Options:
A.  If the patient had HIV, the risk of seroconversion is 20%
B.  If the patient had hepatitis B, risk of seroconversion is 2%
C.  If the patient had Hepatitis C, the risk of seroconversion is 5%
D.  If the patient had HIV, risk of seroconversion is 0.3%
E.  If the patient had Hepatitis B, the risk of seroconversion is 50%

###Answer:",D,"The rate of HBV transmission to susceptible health care workers ranges from 6 to 30% after a single needlestick exposure to an HBV-positive patient. The average incidence of anti-HCV seroconversion after unintentional needle sticks or sharps exposure from an HCV-positive source is 1.8% (range, 07%). Average risk of HIV transmission after a percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood is approximately 0.3%.

###Options:
A.  Pilocarpine
B.  Carbachol
C.  Atropine
D.  Physostigmine
E.  Nicotine

###Answer:",C,"Sarin is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. It causes an increase in ACh levels in tissues that leads to cholinergic crisis by the activation of muscarinic as well as nicotinic receptors. Most of the symptoms of cholinergic crisis are mediated by muscarinic receptors and, therefore, the muscarinic antagonist atropine is used as an antidote for sarin poisoning. Cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine, carbachol, physostigmine (indirect agonists), and nicotine will worsen the symptoms of sarin poisoning",Pilocarpine,Carbachol,Atropine,Physostigmine,Nicotine,C,"C

Rationale: Sarin is a nerve gas that is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine at the synapse, causing overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Atropine is an anticholinergic drug that can be used as an antidote to sarin poisoning. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, which helps to counteract the effects of the excess acetylcholine.",True,model6

Rationale: Luteinizing hormone (LH) is primarily responsible for the production and release of eggs from the ovaries. LH surge triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg from the ovary. This typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. FSH, on the other hand, stimulates the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries, but it is not directly responsible for ovulation.

###Answer:",B,"Bone marrow is the primary site of red blood cell production, where erythropoiesis occurs.",Thymus,Bone marrow,kidney,Liver,Spleen,B,"B.  Bone marrow

Rationale: In adults, the primary site of red blood cell production is the bone marrow. The bone marrow is responsible for producing blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The bone marrow contains stem cells that differentiate into various blood cell types, and it is the primary site of hematopoiesis in adults.

###Answer:",A,Leukoerythroblastic changes on a blood film refer to the presence of immature white blood cells (such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes) and nucleated red blood cells (erythroblasts) in the peripheral blood. These changes are often indicative of bone marrow infiltration.,Leukoerythroblastic changes,Thrombocytopenia,Thrombocytosis,Myeloblasts,Myeloblasts,A,"A

Rationale: Infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant cells or fibrosis can lead to ineffective hematopoiesis, resulting in a blood film that shows features of a leukoerythroblastic reaction. This includes the presence of nucleated red blood cells, immature white cells (myelocytes, promyelocytes), and tear drop cells. This is because the bone marrow is not able to produce blood cells properly, leading to the release of immature cells into the circulation.",True,model6

Yesterday, he allowed her to eat cupcakesand cotton candy at a county fair. At her bedtime that evening, he increased her dose of subcutaneous intermediateacting and long-acting insulin. Her symptoms began 6 hours later, then resolved spontaneously. After being informedthis morning of this nighttime episode, the mother insisted the father bring the patient to the hospital. On arrival, thepatient is alert. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her fingerstick bloodglucose concentration is 72 mg/dL. Urinalysis is negative for glucose and ketones. Which of the following is the mostlikely explanation for this patient's nighttime symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Hyperglycemia caused by increased glucose consumption
B.  Hyperglycemia caused by increased glycogen metabolism
C.  Hyperglycemia caused by insufficient exogenous insulin
D.  Hypoglycemia caused by excess exogenous insulin
E.  Hypoglycemia caused by excessive renal glucose loss

###Answer:",D,"Given the history provided, the patient's father increased her dose of subcutaneous intermediate-acting and long-acting insulin after she consumed high-carbohydrate foods (cupcakes and cotton candy) at the county fair. This increase in insulin likely led to a rapid drop in blood glucose levels, resulting in hypoglycemia. The symptoms of restlessness, sweating, and confusion experienced by the patient are classic manifestations of hypoglycemia in individuals with diabetes.The normal fingerstick blood glucose concentration of 72 mg/dL upon arrival to the emergency department supports the diagnosis of hypoglycemia, as it indicates that the patient's blood glucose levels have normalized by the time of assessment.Therefore, option (D) Hypoglycemia caused by excess exogenous insulin is the most likely explanation for the patient's nighttime symptoms.",Hyperglycemia caused by increased glucose consumption,Hyperglycemia caused by increased glycogen metabolism,Hyperglycemia caused by insufficient exogenous insulin,Hypoglycemia caused by excess exogenous insulin,Hypoglycemia caused by excessive renal glucose loss,D,"D. Hypoglycemia caused by excess exogenous insulin.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of restlessness, sweating, and confusion are consistent with hypoglycemia. The symptoms occurred 6 hours after the bedtime insulin dose, which is consistent with the peak effect of intermediate-acting insulin. The patient's blood glucose level was 72 mg/dL, which is within normal limits, but the patient's symptoms had resolved spontaneously, suggesting that the blood glucose level may have been lower earlier. The patient's urinalysis was negative for glucose and ketones, making hyperglycemia less likely.

###Options:
A.  Southeast Asia.
B.  Russia
C.  Brazil
D.  Southern Europe.
E.  None of the above.

###Answer:",B,"Red blood cells (RBCs) rely on glutathione from the hexose monophosphate shunt to counteract increased reactive oxygen species production, typically induced by drugs or toxins. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defects, the most common congenital issue with this shunt, hinder RBCs' ability to maintain sufficient glutathione levels during oxidant stress. Consequently, hemoglobin precipitates within RBCs, forming Heinz bodies. As the G6PD gene resides on the X chromosome, affected individuals are predominantly males. G6PD deficiency is prevalent in regions historically plagued by malaria, notably among males of African, African American, Sardinian, and Sephardic descent. While most individuals with G6PD deficiency remain asymptomatic, certain triggers like infection, fava bean ingestion, or exposure to oxidative agents can incite acute hemolytic events. Smear examination may reveal bite cells, Heinz bodies, and abnormal poikilocytes. Common precipitants of G6PD crises include dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin. The ensuing anemia is often severe, manifesting rapidly after drug exposure and potentially leading to renal failure.",Southeast Asia.,Russia,Brazil,Southern Europe.,None of the above.,B,"B.

Rationale: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects approximately 400 million people worldwide. It is most commonly seen in people of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency is low in people of Northern European or Russian descent, making screening unnecessary in these populations.

C.  PGE2 stimulates the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary
D.  PGE2 increases the secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"The fetal portion of the placenta releases prostaglandins in high concentrations at the time of labor. This release is associated with deterioration of the placenta.

Rationale: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent stimulator of uterine contraction. During pregnancy, the uterus is quiescent, and any strong stimulation of uterine contraction can lead to abortion. PGE2 can stimulate uterine contraction by increasing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which then binds to calmodulin and activates myosin light-chain kinase, leading to muscle contraction. This is the reason why PGE2 is sometimes used to induce labor or to induce abortion.",True,model6

###Options:
A.  Paraventricular nucleus
B.  Suprachiasmatic nucleus
C.  Ventromedial nucleus
D.  Lateral hypothalamus

###Answer:",D,"The lateral hypothalamus is primarily responsible for regulating hunger and initiating eating behavior. When stimulated, it prompts feeding behavior, while lesions in this area can lead to decreased food intake and even starvation. The ventromedial nucleus, on the other hand, is involved in the regulation of satiety and the termination of eating behavior. The suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates circadian rhythms, while the paraventricular nucleus is involved in various functions, including the regulation of stress responses and the release of oxytocin and vasopressin.",Paraventricular nucleus,Suprachiasmatic nucleus,Ventromedial nucleus,Lateral hypothalamus,,D,"D. Lateral hypothalamus

Rationale: The lateral hypothalamus is primarily responsible for regulating hunger and satiety. It contains neurons that produce orexins (also known as hypocretins), which stimulate appetite and increase food intake. Damage to the lateral hypothalamus can lead to anorexia and weight loss. The ventromedial nucleus is involved in satiety, but it is not the primary regulator of hunger and satiety. The paraventricular nucleus is involved in regulating various physiological processes, including hunger, thirst, and blood pressure, but it is not the primary regulator of hunger and satiety. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock that regulates circadian rhythms, but it is not directly involved in regulating hunger and satiety.",True,model6

He has a fever at 39.5°C and blood pressure is 90/60mmHg, although he is in a lucid state. Bruises can be seen on his skin which he remembers being present before he fell. Blood tests show the patient to have a normocytic anaemia with a low platelet count and increased fibrin split products. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
B.  Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
C.  Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
D.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation
E.  Thalassemia minor

###Answer:",D,"This patient is suffering from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (D), which may have resulted from an infection, in this case causing septicaemia. DIC is characterized by the systemic activation of the coagulation system such that fibrin deposition occurs usually within the microvasculature. RBCs are damaged when crossing such fibres and coagulation factors and platelets are also consumed predisposing to severe bleeding. DIC has various causes. In this case a systemic inflammatory response such as occurs in sepsis is the most likely underlying cause. Thalassaemia (E) tends to produce chronic normocytic or microcytic anaemia without serious bleeding risk. In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (C), there is a defect in an essential cell membrane protein causing intermittent release of haemoglobin, it is believed acidosis during the night increases the degree of haemoglobinuria, hence the term nocturnal. There does not tend to be consumption of coagulation factors. Haemolytic anaemia produces a macrocytic anaemia, in warm antibody disease (A) IgG binds to the red cell membrane, while in cold antibody disease (B) it is IgM. There is no impact upon coagulation factors.",Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Thalassemia minor,D,"D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms, such as fever, hypotension, and bruising, suggest a systemic illness. The blood tests show a normocytic anemia, low platelet count, and increased fibrin split products, which are all consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition where there is widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. This can cause organ dysfunction, bleeding, and bruising. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",True,model6

Rationale: The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is known to affect the coagulation cascade, leading to changes in various clotting factors. The OCP increases the levels of clotting factors I, VII, IX, X, and XII, and decreases the levels of anticoagulant proteins such as protein S and protein C. However, it does not decrease anti-thrombin (antithrombin III) levels. Anti-thrombin is an anticoagulant protein that inhibits the activity of thrombin and other clotting factors.

###Answer:",C,"In the case described, the patient's ongoing symptoms of ""freezing,"" clumsy gait, and rigidity suggest that levodopa therapy alone may not be sufficient to control his symptoms. While MAO-B inhibitors could potentially be considered as adjunct therapy in this patient, they are not the first-line adjunct therapy specifically indicated to address freezing of gait and rigidity, which are more directly targeted by increasing dopamine levels through inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (option A).Therefore, while MAO-B inhibitors could be beneficial in certain cases of Parkinson's disease which is the correct answer.",Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase,Dopamine ²-hydroxylase,Monoamine oxidase B,Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase,Tyrosine hydroxylase,C,"C
Rationale: The patient is experiencing ""wearing off"" effects of carbidopa-levodopa therapy, which can be improved by adding an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), such as selegiline or rasagiline. MAO-B is an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain, and inhibition of this enzyme can increase the availability of dopamine for neurotransmission. The ""freezing"" episodes and clumsy gait suggest that the patient may also benefit from physical therapy and other adjunctive therapies.",True,model6

Which of the following tests is most likely to diagnose this patient's condition?
###Options:
A.  Lumbar puncture
B.  CT head
C.  Brain MRI
D.  Electroencephalogram

###Answer:",C,"A brain MRI would be more appropriate than a lumbar puncture as the patient's history of fever and right-sided weakness would suggest a brain abscess versus meningitis.

An MRI with gadolinium contrast differentiates cerebritis and cerebral edema from an abscess and detects satellite lesions better than a CT.

This patient in the clinical scenario potentially has a brain abscess. MRI is the diagnostic test of choice for a brain abscess as it is more sensitive than a CT scan. MRI can distinguish between pyogenic and nonsuppurative lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging.

An EEG would be appropriate to help diagnose suspected encephalopathy. However, in this clinical scenario, it would be more appropriate to rule out brain abscesses with a brain MRI. People who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of developing brain abscesses.

###Options:
A.  Alendronic acid
B.  Alfentanil
C.  Aldactone
D.  Almotriptan
E.  Alverine

###Answer:",A,Alendronic acid is an oral bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates affect bone metabolism byinhibiting osteoclast activity. Patients taking bisphosphonates are more at risk ofosteonecrosis of the jaws following dental extractions as normal bony remodelling doesnot take place. The risk is greater with more potent bisphosphonates and thoseadministered via an intra-venous route.Alfentanil is a potent opioid analgesic often used for short operative procedures and daycase operating due to its rapid onset of action and short duration of action. Aldactone isan aldosterone antagonist used to treat oedema and ascites in cirrhosis of the liver andcongestive heart failure. Almotriptan is a 5-hydroxytryptamine agonist used to treat acutemigraine. Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant that is used to treat gastro-intestinaldisorders characterised by smooth muscle spasm.,Alendronic acid,Alfentanil,Aldactone,Almotriptan,Alverine,A,"A

###Answer:",C,Peripheral edema is one of the most common side effects of calcium channel blockers. None of the other agents commonly cause peripheral edema,Atenolol,Clonidine,Felodipine,Hydralazine,Prazosin,C,"C. Felodipine

Rationale: Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect. The exact mechanism of this is unclear, but it may be related to the increased blood flow to the periphery and the resulting increased hydrostatic pressure. Calcium channel blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, and peripheral edema is a common side effect of these medications.",True,model6

Rationale: Serum calcium concentration typically increases in:

* Hyperparathyroidism (option D): Hyperparathyroidism is a condition where there is excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to increased calcium levels in the blood.
* Chronic sarcoidosis (option E): Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause hypercalcemia due to the production of vitamin D-like compounds by macrophages.
* Carcinomatosis (option C): Some cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, can produce parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which can cause hypercalcemia.

However, serum calcium concentration typically decreases in:

* Hypoalbuminemia (option A): Albumin binds to calcium, and a decrease in albumin levels can lead to a decrease in total calcium levels, although ionized calcium levels may remain normal.
* Pyloric stenosis (option B): Pyloric stenosis can cause hypocalcemia due to vomiting, which leads to loss of calcium and other electrolytes.",False,model6

###Answer:",A,"The best diagnostic course in this case would be to begin a prospective diary of symptoms for the next 2 months. This would allow the patient to track her symptoms and identify any patterns or correlations with her menstrual cycle. It can help in determining if her symptoms are related to hormonal changes and if further testing or treatment is necessary. Other options such as obtaining hormone levels or performing ultrasound may not provide as much information in this case.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patient's symptoms are cyclical, occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and are relieved by menses. To confirm the diagnosis, a prospective symptom diary is recommended to document the timing and severity of symptoms over 2 months. This will help to establish a pattern of symptoms and rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Serum progesterone levels (option B) may be helpful in diagnosing luteal phase defect, but are not necessary for the diagnosis of PMS. Serum estrogen levels (option C) are not helpful in diagnosing PMS.

###Options:
A.  Cryotherapy of the cervix
B.  Laser ablation of the cervix
C.  Conization of the cervix
D.  Hysterectomy
E.  Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months

###Answer:",C,"One indication for a cone biopsy is when a cervical biopsy or colposcopic impression does not adequately explain the severity of the Pap smear result. In approximately 10% of cases where cervical biopsies are directed by colposcopy, there can be a significant discordance between the Pap smear and biopsy results. For instance, the biopsy may appear normal while the Pap smear indicates severely abnormal cells. Conization of the cervix becomes necessary to rule out lesions higher in the endocervical canal. Simply repeating the Pap smear is not advisable as it may delay treatment of a potentially serious issue. Once cervical dysplasia is confirmed, cryotherapy and laser ablation are viable treatment options. However, these are destructive procedures, meaning no tissue is preserved for histological evaluation, and should not be performed until a definitive diagnosis is made. It's important not to proceed with a hysterectomy in this patient without first resolving the discrepancy between the Pap smear and colposcopic findings.",Cryotherapy of the cervix,Laser ablation of the cervix,Conization of the cervix,Hysterectomy,Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months,E,"E.

Rationale: The patient has an abnormal Pap smear showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) and colposcopy reveals acetowhite changes suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, biopsies do not show any evidence of dysplasia. In this scenario, the most appropriate next step would be to repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months. This is because the patient may have a false-negative biopsy result, and repeating the Pap smear will help to detect any potential development of dysplasia.

His medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His discharge medications include furosemide, carvedilol, and lisinopril. During hospitalization, a 2D echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, lateral wall hypokinesis, and an ejection fraction of 30%. Right ventricular function was normal. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for his cardiomyopathy?
###Options:
A.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy
B.  Hypertensive cardiomyopathy
C.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
D.  Cardiac amyloidosis
E.  Diabetic cardiomyopathy

###Answer:",A,"This patient has new-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and focal left ventricular hypokinesis and has multiple risk factors for ischemic cardiomyopathy, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a long history of smoking. His cardiomyopathy is most likely related to coronary artery disease with resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy usually develop global dysfunction. However, the absence of focal hypokinesis does not rule out ischemic cardiomyopathy, as the patient may have several coronary obstructions or proximal lesions that may present as global dysfunction.

A thorough coronary evaluation is indicated in these patients to rule out ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually have enlarged interventricular septum and left ventricle with normal ejection fraction. This patient has a low ejection fraction, which is less likely to be seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Hypertensive cardiomyopathy

Rationale: The patient's history of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal right ventricular function suggest hypertensive cardiomyopathy as the most likely etiology. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is possible, but the patient's history does not suggest a clear ischemic event. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of lateral wall hypokinesis. Cardiac amyloidosis is also less likely, as it typically affects older patients and is associated with right ventricular dysfunction.

A.  (A)	retroflexion of the uterus
B.  (B)	ovaries caudad to the cervix
C.  (C)	round ligaments attached to the uterus posterior to the insertion of the fallopian tubes
D.  (D)	immobility of the uterus
E.  (E)	cervix not palpable on rectal examination

###Answer:",A,"The cervix protrudes into the fornix of the vagina, and the ovaries are intraperitoneal; therefore, they are found cephalad to the cervix. The round ligaments are attached to the uterus anterior to the attachment of the fallopian tubes. Retroflexion implies a sharp angle between the cervix and the fundus of the uterus, which is bent posteriorly. This is a less common position of the uterus, which can also, more commonly, be midposition or anteflexed. These are all normal positions of the uterus. It is important to recognize which way the uterine body is flexed so that you do not perforate the lower uterine segment while sounding the uterus or dilating the cervix. The uterus is normally mobile and if it is not, adhesions or tumor may be present. The cervix is normally palpated anterior to the rectum on rectal examination.

B.  Sciatic nerve compression from continued compartment swelling
C.  The sural nerve at the mid-fibula from the escharotomy
D.  The tibial nerve at the medial condyle of the femur from the escharotomy
E.  femoral nerve compression

###Answer:",A,"Common peroneal nerve injury at the neck of the fibula results in numbness to the lateral leg and foot drop.

Escharotomy involves incising through areas of burnt skin to release the eschar and its constrictive effects and restore distal circulation without breaching the deep fascial layer. Structures at risk should be marked, such as the common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula so that extra care can be taken to avoid damage to deep structures.

The common peroneal nerve has a relatively superficial course near the incisions. For this reason, an escharotomy should ideally be performed by a plastic or burn surgeon with knowledge of the underlying anatomy. The sural nerve provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle.

Following escharotomy, the wounds should be monitored regularly, especially in the first 72 hours, due to high risk of bleeding, and for signs of incomplete releases, such as distal ischemia in limbs.

Rationale: The patient has a circumferential full-thickness burn to the right lower leg, which is likely to cause compartment syndrome. The escharotomy was performed to relieve the pressure, but the patient still has decreased sensation to the lateral leg and weakness with dorsiflexion of the foot. The most likely cause of these neurologic deficits is the common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula from the escharotomy. The common peroneal nerve is susceptible to injury at the neck of the fibula, and the escharotomy may have caused further damage to the nerve, leading to the observed neurologic deficits.",True,model6

Rationale: Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract illness in children, especially those under 2 years of age. It is characterized by inflammation and constriction of the small airways, leading to wheezing and respiratory distress. The symptoms of fever, cough, wheezing, intercostal retractions, and expiratory grunting are consistent with bronchiolitis.

He is concerned that the lesion could be malignant. He has no significant history and jogs daily for an hour. On physical examination, the swelling is round, mobile, and moves with deglutition. Laboratory testing is normal. Ultrasonography identifies a follicular neoplasm in the right lobe of the thyroid, which is confirmed with fine-needle aspiration. Which of the following confirms that the lesion is benign?
###Options:
A.  The presence of psammoma bodies in the thyroid tissue.
B.  Inflammatory cells spilling into the thyroid parenchyma.
C.  The absence of vascular and capsular invasion.
D.  Bizarre, large, undifferentiated cells with areas of adjacent necrosis.

###Answer:",C,"The most common benign neoplasm in a solitary thyroid nodule is a follicular adenoma. Despite evidence of follicular differentiation, the benign tumor lacks evidence of capsular invasion and lacks papillary carcinoma nuclear features. The patient is typically euthyroid. A thyroid nodule is more common in adults aged 20 to 50 and is usually solitary.

Papillary adenomas are rare, as are piriform sinus fistula, which are congenital communications between the pharynx and neck structures.

An x-ray of his right hand shows widening of the epiphyseal plate, and lab results confirm a vitamin deficiency. Which of the following organs is involved in the activation pathway of the deficient vitamin?
###Options:
A.  Kidney
B.  Pancreas
C.  Bone marrow
D.  Lungs
E.  heart

###Answer:",A,"This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered. Once the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended",Kidney,Pancreas,Bone marrow,Lungs,heart,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with rickets, a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is activated by hydroxylation reactions in the liver and kidneys. The kidney is responsible for the final step of activation, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of the vitamin. This active form plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate metabolism, which is essential for bone growth and development.",True,model6

The medication is diluted in 5% dextrose with water and crystals are noted to have formed. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this medication?
###Options:
A.  Partial antagonism of T-type calcium channels
B.  Enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
C.  Blockade of voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels
D.  Blockade of voltage-dependent membrane sodium channels
E.  C and D above

###Answer:",D,"Phenytoin when diluted in 5% dextrose with water may form crystals.

The dilution of phenytoin is usually with normal saline.

The mechanism of action of phenytoin is through the blockade of voltage-dependent membrane sodium channels.

Phenytoin is not the first drug to be used in the treatment of status epilepticus and benzodiazepines should be used prior to phenytoin in the treatment of status epilepticus.",Partial antagonism of T-type calcium channels,Enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid,Blockade of voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels,Blockade of voltage-dependent membrane sodium channels,C and D above,E,"E. C and D above

Rationale: The medication described in the question is phenytoin. Phenytoin is a hydantoin derivative that is used in the treatment of status epilepticus. It is known to crystallize in solution, particularly when mixed with dextrose. The mechanism of action of phenytoin is blockade of voltage-dependent membrane sodium channels, which leads to a decrease in the excitability of neurons. Additionally, phenytoin also blocks voltage-dependent calcium channels, which further contributes to its anticonvulsant effects.",False,model6

E.  is made up of germ cells.

###Answer:",D,"Ova were thought to arise from this lining. Though they do not, the older terminology persists. The medulla is the central core of the ovary and is continuous with the hilum, where blood vessels and lymphatics gain entrance. The cortex is the outer layer, containing primary oocytes and stroma. The ovary is covered by a thin germinal epithelium, which is not derived from germ cells but from the peritoneum. Understanding this anomalous terminology is important when using embryology to classify ovarian tumors.

###Answer:",A,"The most likely microorganism transmitted to this patient is a nonsegmented virus from the family Rhabdoviridae.

The Rhabdoviridae family of viruses are bullet-shaped and composed of two parts. The first part is considered more structural and is a viral envelope, while the second part is more functional and contains the ribonucleocapsid core.

The virus is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected mammal, including domestic and wild, via saliva entering through broken skin or mucous membranes.

Other routes of infection include inhalation of the virus in an aerosolized form, ingestion, transplacental, and organ transplant.",Nonsegmented virus from the family Rhabdoviridae,segmented virus from the family Rhabdoviridae,Nonsegmented virus from the family Arenaviridae,Segmented virus from the family Arenaviridae,Segmented virus from the family Filoviridae,A,"A.

Rationale: 
Dog bites can transmit rabies virus, which is a nonsegmented virus from the family Rhabdoviridae. Rabies virus is an enveloped RNA virus that is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through bites. The virus attacks the central nervous system, causing encephalitis and eventually death if left untreated.

The free, inferior border of the falciform ligament contains the paraumbilical veins and the round ligament of the liver (aka, ligamentum teres hepatis)

Paraumbilical veins become prominent and more patent during portal hypertension when the portal vein, draining the gastrointestinal system, becomes engorged with blood that is unable to fully enter the liver.

If the portal hypertension is severe enough, the paraumbilical veins will form a caput medusa of engorged blood vessels surrounding the umbilicus.

A positive blood culture, PCR, and anti-phase IgG antibody titer equalling 1:800 (or > 1:1024 in the US) is diagnostic of chronic Q fever (endocarditis).

Endocarditis is a typical presentation of chronic Q fever. Chronic Q fever presents as culture-negative infective endocarditis affecting damaged native and prosthetic valves. Clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with chronic Q fever.

Chronic Q fever ensues from persistent infection culminating in infective endocarditis, vascular prosthesis infection, aneurysm infection, pseudotumor of the lung, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.",Repeat blood cultures,Viral cell culture,Viral hepatitis panel,Indirect immunofluorescent test,direct immunofluorescent test,D,"D. Indirect immunofluorescent test

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. The patient's history of fever, chills, and myalgia 8 months ago suggests that he may have had a previous episode of bacteremia. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly and clubbing of the fingers suggests that the infection may have been ongoing for some time. The laboratory results, including an elevated ESR and CRP, support the diagnosis of an ongoing inflammatory process. The normal transesophageal echocardiogram makes endocarditis less likely, but it does not rule it out. The patient's history of living near a dairy farm and the presence of microscopic hematuria suggest that the patient may have been exposed to Brucella, a bacterium that can cause endocarditis. The indirect immunofluorescent test is used to diagnose brucellosis. It detects the presence of antibodies against Brucella in the patient's serum. The test is sensitive and specific for brucellosis. Repeat blood cultures (Option A) may not reveal the diagnosis, as the patient's blood cultures have already been negative. Viral cell culture (Option B) is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.

She was at a party where she consumed large quantities of alcohol last night and woke up in a chair with these symptoms. She claims never to have had these symptoms before and wants to know if she broke her arm while intoxicated. The patient has no notable medical history, and vitals are within normal limits. She appears diaphoretic and anxious. Physical exam shows no trauma, tenderness, rash, or swelling to the upper extremity, but there is a single well-demarcated red mark on the posterior aspect of the arm. Upon closer inspection, the healthcare provider notices that the symptoms are limited to the fifth and medial fourth digits, and there is tenderness to palpation of the wrist. The involved nerve innervates which of the following muscles?
###Options:
A.  Pronator teres
B.  Triceps brachii
C.  Biceps brachii
D.  Flexor carpi ulnaris
E.  Palmaris longus

###Answer:",D,"The paresthesia and numbness correspond most closely to the ulnar nerve distribution within the hand.

The history of falling asleep in a chair after drinking is relevant as a common cause of prolonged position-dependent compression of the body. If the patient falls asleep in the chair, the arms are often outstretched, with the medial aspect resting on the surface. Compression of the ulnar nerve, most commonly at the elbow, results in cubital fossa syndrome.

The ulnar nerve innervates the forearm muscles, including the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor carpi ulnaris. It also innervates the hand muscles, such as the lumbricals, palmaris brevis, hypothenar, and interosseous muscles.

The median nerve innervates the pronator teres, the radial nerve innervates the triceps brachii, and the musculocutaneous nerve innervates the biceps brachii.",Pronator teres,Triceps brachii,Biceps brachii,Flexor carpi ulnaris,Palmaris longus,D,"D

Rationale: The symptoms described are consistent with compression of the ulnar nerve, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome. The ulnar nerve runs posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus and is compressed when the elbow is flexed. This compression can cause numbness and tingling in the fifth and medial fourth digits. The ulnar nerve innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, which is responsible for flexing the wrist and fingers. The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described. Pronator teres is innervated by the median nerve, triceps brachii is innervated by the radial nerve, biceps brachii is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, and palmaris longus is innervated by the median nerve.",True,model6

D.  Obtain stool studies and prescribe antibiotics
E.  ABdominal Uss

###Answer:",A,"The best treatment for a patient who does not demonstrate any signs of significant dehydration is to treat symptomatically with antiemetics and ensure the patient can tolerate oral rehydration

The patient in the scenario does not have any physical exam findings of severe dehydration

Viral gastroenteritis is a clinical diagnosis and does not require blood work or radiographic studies for diagnosis

The patient does not display any ""red flag"" symptoms and his presentation is consistent with simple viral gastroenteritis",Antiemetic medications and ORT,Check a CBC and CMP,CT abdomen,Obtain stool studies and prescribe antibiotics,ABdominal Uss,A,"A

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral gastroenteritis. The lack of fever, abdominal pain, and the presence of moist mucous membranes and normal skin turgor suggest that the patient is not dehydrated. The patient's history of consuming food from a local seller 12 hours prior to the onset of symptoms also supports the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. The next best step is to provide antiemetic medications and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent dehydration. Stool studies and antibiotics are not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a bacterial infection. A CBC and CMP are also not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not concerning for a more serious underlying condition.

Rationale: Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is a type of E. coli that produces enterotoxins, which cause a secretory diarrhea. It is a common cause of diarrhea in both children and adults, particularly in developing countries. ETEC is also the leading cause of travelers' diarrhea, which is a type of diarrhea that occurs in people who travel to areas where the bacterium is common. The bacterium is usually acquired through contaminated food or water. Symptoms of ETEC infection typically include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. In some cases, the diarrhea may be bloody. ETEC infection is usually self-limiting, but it can be severe and lead to dehydration, particularly in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.",True,model6

Her valproic acid level falls within the therapeutic range. Subsequently, a 24-hour video electroencephalogram (EEG) is arranged. Throughout the EEG monitoring period, the patient experiences several instances of tonic and clonic movements accompanied by moaning and crying, yet with no associated loss of bowel or bladder control. The attending neurologist reports that despite these episodes, the EEG records excessive muscle artifact but no epileptiform discharges. In this clinical scenario, what would be the most appropriate course of treatment?
###Options:
A.  Adjust the dosage of valproic acid by increasing it.
B.  Incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate her muscular symptoms.
C.  Request a psychiatric assessment for further evaluation.
D.  Introduce carbamazepine as an adjunct to her existing seizure medication regimen.
E.  Discontinue all seizure medications.

###Answer:",C,"Seizure-like manifestations devoid of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) are indicative of pseudoseizures. These episodes often present with convincing seizure-like behaviors, including atypical posturing and vocalizations, albeit typically without loss of sphincter control. Furthermore, self-inflicted harm is uncommon, and pupillary response to light remains intact. Pseudoseizures may arise deliberately or as part of a conversion disorder, thus negating the necessity for antiepileptic medication. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that a subset of patients experiencing pseudoseizures may also suffer from genuine epileptic seizures; hence, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs is unwarranted. The optimal approach involves initiating psychiatric or psychological evaluation as the cornerstone of pseudoseizure management.",Adjust the dosage of valproic acid by increasing it.,Incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate her muscular symptoms.,Request a psychiatric assessment for further evaluation.,Introduce carbamazepine as an adjunct to her existing seizure medication regimen.,Discontinue all seizure medications.,C,"C.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are not accompanied by any loss of bowel or bladder control, which is a characteristic feature of seizures. Moreover, the EEG records excessive muscle artifact but no epileptiform discharges, suggesting that the episodes are not of an epileptic nature. The patient's symptoms are more indicative of a conversion disorder, which is a psychiatric condition characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms without any underlying organic cause.

###Options:
A.  hypokalaemia
B.  hypomagnesaemia
C.  hypercalcaemia
D.  hyperuricaemia
E.  hyperkalaemia

- Hypomagnesaemia (B) due to magnesium loss in the urine
- Hyperuricaemia (D) due to increased reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys
- Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
- Ototoxicity

However, furosemide does not cause hypercalcaemia (C). In fact, it can cause hypocalcaemia due to increased calcium excretion in the urine. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

D.  Impaired release of insulin by the pancreas
E.  Auto-immune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells

###Answer:",B,"In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, a condition known as insulin resistance.

Rationale: 
Febrile seizures are a type of seizure that occurs in children in association with a fever, typically between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. They are usually generalized seizures, meaning they affect both sides of the brain. Option A is incorrect because febrile seizures can occur with other conditions that cause fever, not just elevated temperature.

###Answer:",B,"Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is attributed to inhibition of calcium absorption as well as bone formation. Increased intake of calcium plus vitamin D, bisphosphonates, or other drugs that are effective in this condition is indicated. Glucocorticoids suppress rather than stimulate the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis. The decreased production of prostaglandins does not play a role in bone formation",Increase the excretion of calcium.,Inhibit absorption of calcium.,Stimulate the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal  axis.,Decrease production of prostaglandins.,Decrease collagen synthesis,B,"B

Rationale: Glucocorticoids can cause osteoporosis by inhibiting calcium absorption from the gut, increasing calcium excretion in the urine, and inhibiting the production of osteoblasts, which are the cells responsible for bone formation. They also increase the production of osteoclasts, which are the cells responsible for bone resorption. This can lead to a net loss of bone mass and an increased risk of osteoporosis.",True,model6

A review of systems is positive for fatigue, mild dyspnea, and abdominal pain. His physical examination reveals an ill-looking patient with painful hepatomegaly. Laboratory testing shows elevated lactate dehydrogenase and moderate normochromic anemia with polychromasia on the blood smear. Flow cytometry reveals an absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in the red cells. What is the diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Fanconi anemia
B.  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
C.  Acute myeloid leukemia
D.  Hereditary spherocytosis
E.  multiple myeloma

###Answer:",B,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a life-threatening acquired disorder characterized by complement-mediated hemolytic anemia and a prothrombotic state that increases the risk of splanchnic vein thrombosis more specifically.

PNH is caused by an intrinsic defect in the cell membrane that renders erythrocytes abnormally susceptible to attack by the complement system.

Hematuria in the morning is a rare finding, but the disease got its name after the observation of this finding in the early descriptions of affected patients.

Diagnosis relies on immunophenotyping of granulocytes and erythrocytes to show a deficiency of the GPI-anchored antigens CD55 and CD59, or more recently, the fluorescein-labeled aerolysin (FLAER) test.",Fanconi anemia,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Acute myeloid leukemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,multiple myeloma,B,"B

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of tea-colored urine, fatigue, dyspnea, and abdominal pain are consistent with hemolytic anemia. The laboratory findings of elevated lactate dehydrogenase and normochromic anemia with polychromasia on the blood smear support this diagnosis. The absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on flow cytometry is a specific diagnostic test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

###Answer:",C,"Pyloric stenosis, also known as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), is an uncommon condition in infants characterized by abnormal thickening of the pylorus muscles in the stomach leading to gastric outlet obstruction. Clinically infants are well at birth. Then, at 3 to 6 weeks of age, the infants present with ""projectile"" vomiting, potentially leading to dehydration and weight loss.

The radiologist plays a central role in diagnosing this condition. The treatment is surgical.

Ultrasonography has become the standard imaging technique for diagnosing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

It is reliable, highly sensitive, highly specific, and easily performed. An experienced ultrasonographer is necessary to diagnose pyloric stenosis.",Upper GI series with diluted barium,Abdominal x-ray with 20 cc air gavage,Ultrasound abdomen,Endoscopy,,C,"C

Rationale: 
The symptoms described in the question, such as projectile vomiting after every feeding, weight loss, and an olive-shaped mass in the abdomen, are highly suggestive of pyloric stenosis. Ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice for pyloric stenosis. It is non-invasive and can accurately measure the pyloric muscle thickness and pyloric channel length, which are usually increased in pyloric stenosis. Upper GI series with diluted barium (Option A) may also be used to diagnose pyloric stenosis, but it involves radiation exposure and is not as sensitive as ultrasound. Abdominal x-ray with 20 cc air gavage (Option B) is not a useful test for diagnosing pyloric stenosis. Endoscopy (Option D) is not necessary for diagnosing pyloric stenosis and may not provide any additional information. Therefore, Option C (Ultrasound abdomen) is the correct answer.",True,model6

###Answer:",B,"Multiple myeloma is a type of plasma cell cancer characterized by hypercalcemia, renal problems, anemia, and bone pains. Bence Jones proteins are lambda light chains in the urine.

These light chain proteins are found in multiple myeloma, which is the diagnosis in this patient, and is used to monitor therapy.

Today, beta-2 microglobulin is a strong predictor of multiple myeloma outcomes.

Plain X-rays remain the gold standard for imaging newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.",Chest x-ray showing hilar lymphadenopathy,Bence Jones proteins,Bone marrow biopsy showing lymphocytes,Increased white blood cells count and lymphocytes in the blood,decreased white blood cells count and lymphocytes in the blood,B,"B

Rationale: 
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The presence of bone pain, anemia, and elevated creatinine suggests kidney damage, which is common in multiple myeloma. Bence Jones proteins, which are light chains of immunoglobulins, are often present in the urine of patients with multiple myeloma. The other options are not as likely to be present in this patient. Hilar lymphadenopathy is more commonly seen in lymphoma (Option A). A bone marrow biopsy showing lymphocytes is more consistent with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Option C). An increased white blood cell count and lymphocytes in the blood is more consistent with leukemia or lymphoma (Option D). A decreased white blood cell count and lymphocytes in the blood is not typically seen in multiple myeloma (Option E).",True,model6

###Options:
A.  3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency
B.  11-hydroxylase deficiency
C.  17-hydroxylase deficiency
D.  21-hydroxylase deficiency
E.  2-hydroxylase deficiency

###Answer:",E,"21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Normally, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 21-hydroxylase to aldosterone and cortisol. The lack of 21-hydroxylase, therefore, leads to a deficiency of these two adrenal hormones.

The majority of affected neonates have results greater than3500 ng/dL (105 nmol/L). A very high random serum concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is highly suggestive of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

However, the most definitive test is the ACTH stimulation test.

Rationale: 
The symptoms presented, including ambiguous genitalia and elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, are consistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The most common cause of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which accounts for approximately 90% of cases. This enzyme is necessary for the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol in the adrenal gland. Without this enzyme, 17-hydroxyprogesterone accumulates and is shunted into the androgen synthesis pathway, leading to the development of ambiguous genitalia in females.",False,model6

Rationale: 
Cephalosporin is a safe antibiotic choice for pregnant women. It is effective against most bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and has a good safety profile in pregnancy. Tetracycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its potential to cause fetal tooth discoloration and bone growth suppression. Sulfonamides, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, are also contraindicated in the third trimester due to the risk of kernicterus in the newborn.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are typically caused by Escherichia coli. The recommended treatment for these infections is usually a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. However, due to increasing resistance to these agents, nitrofurantoin is becoming a preferred first-line agent for uncomplicated UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is a urinary tract antibiotic that is concentrated in the urine and has a low risk of resistance. It is effective against E. coli and has a low risk of side effects. Vancomycin is typically reserved for serious infections such as MRSA, penicillin is not effective against E. coli, and azithromycin is typically used for respiratory infections.",True,model6

The patient denied any associated symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, hematemesis. History negative for active tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Physical examination was unremarkable. Routine blood work was unremarkable as well. The patient was evaluated with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which was negative for esophagitis or any other abnormality. Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?
###Options:
A.  Upper GI series with barium radiographs
B.  High-resolution esophageal manometry
C.  Ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring study
D.  Referral for surgical evaluation
E.  x-ray of esophagus

###Answer:",C,"This patients presenting symptoms are likely consistent with medically refractory GERD, given that patient is symptomatic despite being maintained on maximal PPI therapy. Considering, this patient already was evaluated with an upper endoscopy which is the first step in evaluating patients with GERD and was unremarkable, the next step in the management of this patient would be to consider an evaluation with an ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring study to check for correlation of his symptoms with pathological acid exposure.

Medically refractory GERD is increasingly becoming common, and patients often have normal endoscopy evaluation as PPIs are extremely effective in healing esophagitis caused by the refluxate.

Ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring can assess the correlation of symptoms with abnormal acid exposure and is indicated in medically refractory GERD and also in patients with extraesophageal symptoms suspicious for GERD.

Ambulatory reflux (pH or in combination with impedance) monitoring employs the utility of a telemetry pH capsule or a transnasal catheter. It is the only available test that detects pathological acid exposure, frequency of reflux episodes, and correlation of symptoms with reflux episodes.",Upper GI series with barium radiographs,High-resolution esophageal manometry,Ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring study,Referral for surgical evaluation,x-ray of esophagus,C,"C

Rationale: The patient has recurrent reflux symptoms despite being on maximal proton pump inhibitor therapy, and the EGD was negative for esophagitis or any other abnormality. The next step in the management of this patient would be to perform an ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring study, such as 24-hour pH impedance testing, to determine if there is ongoing acid reflux despite therapy.

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is B. Fluid therapy is an appropriate treatment for most forms of shock when evidence of organ hypoperfusion persists. In cardiogenic shock there is a low cardiac output and the heart will be operating on the flat part of the FrankStarling curve. Increasing venous return is unlikely to increase cardiac output, which may stay the same or fall. Fluid therapy in these circumstances may make pulmonary oedema and hypoxia worse.

Rationale: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which is a mechanical obstruction to the left ventricular outflow. The symptoms of heart failure and the echocardiographic findings are indicative of severe aortic stenosis. The treatment of choice for severe aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement (AVR). Medical therapy may be used to manage symptoms, but it is not a definitive treatment. Balloon valvuloplasty is not effective in calcified aortic valves and is associated with a high restenosis rate. Assessing the mean gradient across the aortic valve during dobutamine infusion is used in patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to determine if the valve area is truly small or if the low gradient is due to a low cardiac output.

Rationale: The symptoms described in the newborn, such as respiratory distress, cyanosis, and absence of urine output, are indicative of a severe congenital anomaly. The physical examination findings of a flat face, broad nose, club feet, and absence of a sacrum suggest a diagnosis of VACTERL (Vertebral, Anal, Cardiac, Tracheo-Esophageal, Renal, and Limb) association or caudal regression syndrome. The absence of a sacrum is a characteristic feature of caudal regression syndrome, which is often associated with maternal diabetes. However, in this case, the mother is a Hausa Fulani woman, which makes maternal diabetes less likely. The most likely diagnosis is therefore VACTERL association, which can be associated with renal agenesis. Renal agenesis would also explain the absence of urine output in the newborn.",True,model6

Rationale: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which results in an overproduction of androgens. The treatment of CAH involves replacing the deficient hormone, which in this case is cortisol. Administering a glucocorticoid, such as hydrocortisone, helps to suppress the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and, subsequently, the overproduction of androgens.

A.  0 to 30 degrees
B.  30 to 70 degrees
C.  70 to 90 degrees
D.  greater than 90 degrees
E.  80 to 90 degrees

###Answer:",B,"In this case, the patient suffers from lumbar radiculopathy, often referred to as sciatica, which is most likely secondary to a lower lumbar disc herniation. Sciatica is a debilitating condition in which the patient experiences pain and/or paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution or an associated lumbosacral nerve root.

Any condition that may structurally impact or compress the sciatic nerve may cause sciatica symptoms. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. In the older population, lumbar spinal stenosis may also cause these symptoms. Spondylolisthesis or a relative misalignment of one vertebra relative to another may also result in sciatic symptoms.

Patients with sciatica usually experience pain in the lumbar spine, and almost invariably, the pain will be unilateral. A common characteristic is that pain may radiate to the ipsilateral affected extremity. Patients may often describe pain or a burning sensation deep in the buttocks, and they will frequently describe paresthesia that accompanies the pain. Less commonly, there are associated with ipsilateral leg weakness.

The straight-leg test is a passive examination. The straight-leg test is performed by having the patient lie in a relaxed, supine position. The examiner then lifts the leg from the posterior aspect flexing at the hip joint and keeping the knee in full extension or keeping the leg straight. Typically pain that is reproduced between 30 to 70 degrees of hip flexion and experienced primarily in the back is likely due to a lumbar disc herniation.

###Options:
A.  Arterial Po2
B.  Right atrial pressure
C.  Aortic pressure
D.  Left ventricular pressure
E.  None of the above

",Arterial Po2,Right atrial pressure,Aortic pressure,Left ventricular pressure,None of the above,B,"B

Rationale: Before birth, the placenta provides oxygenation of the blood, so the Po2 in the umbilical arteries and veins is higher than in the aorta and pulmonary artery. However, the Po2 in the aorta and pulmonary artery is still lower than the Po2 in the umbilical arteries and veins. Therefore, option A is incorrect. 

Before birth, the right atrial pressure is higher than the left atrial pressure because the majority of the blood returning to the heart comes from the placenta through the umbilical vein, which empties into the inferior vena cava and then the right atrium. After birth, the right atrial pressure decreases as the umbilical vein closes and the liver takes over the majority of the blood flow. Therefore, option B is correct. 

Before birth, the aortic pressure is lower than the pulmonary artery pressure because the pulmonary artery pressure is higher due to the high resistance in the collapsed lungs. After birth, the aortic pressure increases and the pulmonary artery pressure decreases as the lungs expand and the resistance in the lungs decreases. Therefore, option C is incorrect. 

Before birth, the left ventricular pressure is lower than the right ventricular pressure because the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs and the left ventricle pumps blood to the aorta.

Rationale: Gastric outlet obstruction due to chronic duodenal ulcer is best treated by bilateral truncal vagotomy and partial gastrectomy (antrectomy). This is because the obstruction is usually due to extensive cicatrization of the pylorus and duodenum, making a pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy alone difficult or impossible. A partial gastrectomy (antrectomy) is necessary to bypass the obstruction and provide a safe drainage of the stomach. Highly selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty or selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty are not suitable options in this scenario as they are not effective in relieving the obstruction. Heineken-Milkulz procedure is a vagotomy and pyloroplasty, which is also not suitable for gastric outlet obstruction.",False,model6

pH	7.23
pCO2	22 mmHg
pO2	100 mmHg
In addition to supportive care with oxygen and fluids, IV access and bloods are obtained. Renal function results show:

Na+	143 mEq/L
K+	4.2 mEq/L
Chloride	109 mEq/L
Bicarbonate	12 mEq/L
Urea	2.1 mg/dL
Creatinine	0.9 mg/dL
Glucose	127 mg/dL
Which one of the following diagnoses would be most consistent with these results?


###Options:
A.  Massive pulmonary embolism
B.  Methanol poisoning
C.  Paraquat poisoning
D.  Diabetic ketoacidosis
E.  Lead poisoning

###Answer:",B,"This patient has a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis which may be caused by methanol poisoning.

Methanol is a toxic alcohol that can cause metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and an elevated anion gap.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of uncontrolled diabetes that can cause metabolic acidosis. In this case, the blood gases show a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and an elevated anion gap, which are consistent with metabolic acidosis. However, normal glucose levels make DKA an unlikely diagnosis.

Paraquat is a herbicide that can cause acute lung injury, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. Renal functions are normal in this patient.",Massive pulmonary embolism,Methanol poisoning,Paraquat poisoning,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Lead poisoning,D,"D. Diabetic ketoacidosis

Rationale: The patient's acid-base status is consistent with a metabolic acidosis, with a low pH and low bicarbonate levels. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, which is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. The anion gap is calculated as follows: anion gap = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) = 143 - (109 + 12) = 22, which is elevated. This is consistent with the presence of unmeasured anions, such as ketones, which are produced in diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's normal renal function and lack of respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis (pCO2 is not elevated) support this diagnosis.",False,model6

She mentions that she returned from a trip to Hawaii 10 days ago. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medication. Vitals are blood pressure 112/62 mmHg, heart rate  95 bpm, respiratory rate 12 breaths/min, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Physical examination reveals conjunctival redness without exudate. Generalized muscle tenderness is present. Laboratory investigations show a leukocyte count of 8800 cells/mm3, platelet count of 90,000/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase level of 82 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase level of 77 U/L. What measure could have most likely prevented this patients condition?
###Options:
A.  Preexposure prophylaxis with chloroquine
B.  Pretravel vaccination
C.  Applying mosquito repellant
D.  Avoiding exposure to stagnant water
E.  none

###Answer:",D,"The most likely diagnosis, considering the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, is leptospirosis.

The infection is acquired by coming into contact with infected animals or their urine. Leptospira can be acquired after contact with contaminated soil and water.

Avoiding wading in still and stagnant water contaminated by animal feces and urine can prevent infection.

Preexposure prophylaxis with chloroquine is effective for malaria prevention when traveling to endemic areas. Applying mosquito repellant can be used to prevent dengue infection. Preexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline can be considered if there is a high risk of exposure.",Preexposure prophylaxis with chloroquine,Pretravel vaccination,Applying mosquito repellant,Avoiding exposure to stagnant water,none,B,"B

Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of fever, myalgia, headache, conjunctival redness, and generalized muscle tenderness, which are consistent with dengue fever. The patient had recently traveled to Hawaii, which is an area where dengue fever is endemic. Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. There is no vaccine available for dengue fever in the United States, but a vaccine is available in some countries. If the patient had received pretravel vaccination, it could have most likely prevented this patient's condition.",False,model6

The liquor was meconium stained. At5min of age his hrt rate was 96/min. The baby was gasping and there was no response to the nasal catheter. He was also floppy and pale.  The following are true

###Options:
A.  The Apgar score is 2
B.  Endotracheal intubation after adequate suctioning is indicated for the administration of oxygen
C.  IV administration of alkali is the 1st priority
D.  Pneumothorax is a possible complication
E.  Seizure within the 1st 24hr will be unusual

###Answer:",A,"Sunctioning of the airway and intubation to administer oxygen is an important intervention, a possible complication is pneumothorax",The Apgar score is 2,Endotracheal intubation after adequate suctioning is indicated for the administration of oxygen,IV administration of alkali is the 1st priority,Pneumothorax is a possible complication,Seizure within the 1st 24hr will be unusual,A,"A

Rationale: The Apgar score is calculated based on 5 parameters: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. In this case, the heart rate is 96/min (1 point), the baby is gasping (1 point), the baby is floppy (0 points), and the baby is pale (0 points). There is no information about reflex irritability, but since the baby is gasping and floppy, it is likely to be 0 points. Therefore, the Apgar score is 2.",True,model6
