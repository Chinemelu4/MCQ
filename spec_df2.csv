###Options:
A.  Hyperthyroidism
B.  Cushings disease
C.  Acromegaly
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Diabetes

###Answer:",C,"Acromegaly (C) is most commonly due to a pituitary tumour usually identified on MRI scan, patients most frequently present with changes in appearance followed by visual defects and headaches. Sleep apnoea is often a common complaint among patients due to weight gain. Other manifestations include large hands and feet, hirsutism, prominent and coarse facial features, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypertension, diabetes and heart failure among others. The glucose tolerance test is diagnostic for suspected acromegaly, GH levels can be measured directly, although elevated findings are not sufficient for diagnosis. Hyperthryoidism (A) produces symptoms that are usually secondary to an elevation in metabolic rate, such symptoms include diarrhoea, goitre, sweating and intolerance to the temperature whereby the patient consistently feels hot irrespective of the true environmental temperature. Sleep apnoea is not usually a complaint among patients since they often lose weight despite an increased appetite. Cushings disease (B) results from a pituitary tumour producing excess ACTH, the excess cortisol levels result in symptoms such as striae, bruising, thin skin, weight gain (particularly in the abdominal region) and often a dorsocervical fat pad (buffalo hump). Hypothyroidism (D) features include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. Patients do not tend to sweat more and the disease does not coarsen facial features.

###Options:
A.  Bone marrow biopsy
B.  Serum ferritin
C.  Serum transferrin
D.  Total iron binding capacity
E.  Serum iron

###Answer:",B,"Iron deficiency can be an important cause of anaemia in patients. In this case vitamin B12 and folic acid are less likely to be important given the patients diet, however tea is alkaline and reduces the bodys ability to effectively absorb iron. Measuring the patients serum ferritin (B) provides an accurate reflection of the bodys iron stores since the serum ferritin 208 Section 7: Haematology originates from the storage pools in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. Be aware that ferritin measurements are only accurate when CRP is normal since both ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants. The serum transferrin (C) level reflects the levels of protein that bind to iron and transports it around the body and is usually 33 per cent saturated, hence not providing the most accurate level of iron. The serum iron level (E) is a poor reflection of iron stores since this can change dependent on disease states. In iron deficiency anaemia, the serum iron and iron stores are low, however in anaemia of chronic disease iron stores are increased yet the serum iron level is reduced. The total iron binding capacity (D) specifically saturates transferrin in order to measure the iron-carrying capacity in the body rather than iron stores and so would not be appropriate here.

###Options:
A.  Metabolic alkalosis
B.  Decreased creatinine levels
C.  Raised Lactate level
D.  Decreased calcium levels
E.  Reduced Lactate level

###Answer:",C,"Salicylate toxicity is a medical emergency. Intentional ingestion or accidental overdose can cause severe metabolic derangements making treatment difficult.

As it is metabolized, it causes an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Lactate levels then increase due to the increase in anaerobic metabolism.

The lactic acid, along with an added contribution from the salicylate metabolites results in metabolic acidosis.

Initially, there is hyperventilation, but eventually, the patient fatigues and is no longer able to compensate via hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis prevails.",Metabolic alkalosis,Decreased creatinine levels,Raised Lactate level,Decreased calcium levels,Reduced Lactate level,C,"C. Raised Lactate level Rationale:
The patient's presentation is consistent with an overdose of painkillers, such as salicylates. Salicylate overdose can cause a metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by an increased lactate level. This is due to the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to anaerobic metabolism and lactate production. The other options are not typically associated with salicylate overdose.",True,model2

His symptoms developed after returning from a hiking trip to Colorado. Vital signs are temperature 98.6 F (37 C), blood pressure 110/87 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on ambient air. Physical examination demonstrates mild jaundice and normal cardiopulmonary auscultation and is negative for hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, or peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. Lab values are as follows: total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.1 mg/dL, LDH 120 U/L, ALT 20 U/L, AST 15 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 110 U/L. Hemoglobin is 16 g/dL, reticulocyte count 1%, and haptoglobin 125 mg/dL. Given the likely diagnosis, what is the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?
###Options:
A.  Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin
B.  Reduced copper excretion
C.  Iron overload
D.  Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease
E.  copper overload

###Answer:",A,"Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism. The pathogenesis is thought to be secondary to either reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase (UG1A1) or reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the liver. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and excreted in bile.

In addition to reduced conjugation of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin with UG1A1, reduced uptake of unconjugated bilirubin in the liver may also be important in a subset of patients.

Triggers can precipitate the development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Gilbert syndrome. Potential triggers include stress, overexertion, fasting, intercurrent illness, menstruation, and dehydration. Patients with Gilbert syndrome exhibit mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels. Typically, there is no evidence of other disorders to explain the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert syndrome does not require treatment. When confronted with patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the healthcare provider needs to consider other causes, including but not limited to hemolytic reactions, resorbing hematomas, dyserythropoiesis, Wilson disease, and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Patients with hemolysis will exhibit an elevated reticulocyte count, high LDH, and low haptoglobin. Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism that will typically show other manifestations on physical and laboratory examinations not seen in this patient. Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome present with much higher unconjugated bilirubin levels. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload and typically shows physical or laboratory abnormalities not seen in this patient. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis are autoimmune liver diseases and will present differently than shown in this patient.",Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin,Reduced copper excretion,Iron overload,Inflammation secondary to autoimmune liver disease,copper overload,A,"A. Reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin Rationale:
The patient's symptoms, physical exam, and lab findings suggest Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition characterized by reduced hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin. This leads to elevated levels of indirect bilirubin, resulting in mild jaundice. The other options are not relevant to Gilbert's syndrome.",True,model2

The headaches wake him up from sleep and are accompanied by conjunctival injection and increased lacrimation. He recalls having the same symptoms 2 years ago, for which he was given oxygen by inhalation with an improvement of symptoms. What is another abortive treatment of choice for this type of headache?
###Options:
A.  Subcutaneous triptan
B.  Ibuprofen
C.  Verapamil
D.  Intranasal lidocaine
E.  Propanolol

###Answer:",A,"Cluster headaches are the only type of headache in which 100% oxygen therapy is used. Patients can also use subcutaneous or intranasal triptans.

Oxygen should be given at 100%. It works if given within an hour after the headache starts. Medical personnel often have difficulty obtaining insurance approval for at-home oxygen for cluster headaches and must have other options available.

Triptans are considered first-line treatments for aborting cluster headaches. However, the time of onset in oral triptans is considered unacceptable for therapy. Cluster headaches can last as short as 15 minutes and thus require a faster onset, such as subcutaneously or intranasally delivered.

Ibuprofen is not recommended in the treatment of a cluster headache patient. Intranasal lidocaine is also often used for treatment, though it is not as effective. Verapamil is used as preventive therapy.",Subcutaneous triptan,Ibuprofen,Verapamil,Intranasal lidocaine,Propanolol,A,"A. Subcutaneous triptan Rationale: Subcutaneous triptans, such as sumatriptan, are the first-line abortive treatment of choice for cluster headaches. They act as serotonin receptor agonists, causing vasoconstriction and reducing pain transmission. The other options are not as effective for the acute treatment of cluster headaches:  Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that may provide some pain relief but is not specific for cluster headaches.
 Verapamil and propranolol are preventive medications used to reduce the frequency of cluster headaches.
 Intranasal lidocaine is sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy but is not as effective as triptans.",True,model2

What preventative measure would have the greatest impact in reducing this patient's endometrial cancer risk? 
###Options:
A.  Increase daily metformin dosage
B.  Discontinue combination oral contraceptive pills
C.  Weight Loss
D.  Smoking cessation
E.  Healthy eating

###Answer:",C,"The relative risk of endometrial cancer is 2.5 times higher in women with a BMI of >30 kg/m2 compared with those of normal weight. For this reason, individuals with an elevated BMI will reduce their risk of endometrial cancer with healthy weight loss. Weight loss of e5% of body weight results in a 30% lower risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women.

Women who are obese have a high risk of endometrial cancer because fatty tissues convert androstenedione to estrogen. Unopposed estrogen exposure is the leading risk factor for developing endometrial cancer.

In the vignette, the patient has a clinical presentation consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with chronic anovulation, another cause of unopposed estrogen. Additionally, decreased physical activity and high fat and glycemic index diets have been associated with an increased endometrial cancer risk.

She has a history of hypertension and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes. On examination, there is mild upper arm weakness, hip flexion is 4/5 bilaterally, with bilateral wasting and flickers of fasciculations in the right quadriceps. Knee extension is 4/5. Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are strong. Brisk knee and ankle reflexes are elicited, as well as a positive Hoffmans and Babinskis sign. Sensory examination and cranial nerves are normal. Her BM is 8.9, her pulse is regular and her blood pressure is 178/97. What is the most likely diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Myasthenia gravis
B.  Diabetic neuropathy
C.  Myositis
D.  Motor neurone disease
E.  Multiple sclerosis (MS)

###Answer:",D,"This woman presents with upper (brisk reflexes, upgoing plantar) and lower (fasciculations) motor neurone signs. Motor neurone disease (MND) (D) presents with mixed upper and lower motor neurone signs and importantly no sensory involvement. In this case, there is involvement of two regions (arms and legs). Bulbar signs, such as tongue wasting and fasciculation, often help make the diagnosis. Myositis (C) affects the muscle, resulting in tenderness, wasting and fasciculation but no upper motor neurone (UMN) signs. Although the patient is diabetic, neuropathies (B) result in lower motor neurone (LMN) signs only. These may be motor and/or sensory. Typically, diabetes results in a peripheral neuropathy, most commonly sensory. The proximal distribution of weakness would be in keeping with myasthenia (A), but not the UMN signs. There is no mention of fatigability, which is a key feature. MS (E) in this age group is less common and an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system would not result in LMN signs.",Myasthenia gravis,Diabetic neuropathy,Myositis,Motor neurone disease,Multiple sclerosis (MS),D,"D. Motor neurone disease Rationale:
The patient's presentation is consistent with motor neurone disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs (weakness, wasting, fasciculations, and brisk reflexes), along with the positive Hoffman's and Babinski's signs, is highly suggestive of MND.

She presented to the emergency department with significant and progressive right-sided jaw pain that began a few days ago. She had undergone a tooth extraction 2 to 3 months ago. On exam, there was evidence of gingival swelling and erythema around the area of her vacated tooth. Complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and plain radiographs of the area were unremarkable. She has a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and breast adenocarcinoma with bony metastases. She has been taking the following medications for the last two years: lisinopril, amlodipine, metformin, glipizide, and denosumab. Which of the following is the least likely predisposing factor for developing the etiology of the patient's jaw pain?
###Options:
A.  Poor dentition
B.  Recent tooth extraction
C.  Treatment of diabetes with glipizide
D.  Treatment of bony metastases with denosumab
E.  old age

###Answer:",C,"Glipizide is a sulfonylurea. Its mechanism of action is to bind and thus inhibit K-ATP channels, leading to increased insulin secretion. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is not a known side effect of glipizide.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a known but rare side effect of denosumab. Symptoms may include jaw pain, tooth infection, bone, gingival erosion, and toothache. Denosumab should not be initiated until dental health is optimized.

Predisposing factors for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw include poor dentition, recent dental surgery/tooth extraction, osteoclast inhibitor therapy (denosumab, bisphosphonates), and/or concurrent antineoplastic therapy. An increased risk of being diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the jaw correlates directly to the duration of denosumab exposure.

They last for 0 to 30 minutes. He used subcutaneous sumatriptan to abort the headaches, but now his headaches have become increasingly resistant to treatment. What treatment option can be used to prevent these episodes?
###Options:
A.  Verapamil
B.  Ergotamine
C.  Melatonin
D.  Oral sumatriptan
E.  paracetamol

###Answer:",A,"A thorough history is essential to the diagnosis of cluster headaches. Patients will reveal that they experience 10 out of 10 unilateral pain, most often intra or supraorbitally. Patients must have at least 1 autonomic symptom ipsilateral to the side with pain.

The hypothalamus has a definite association with cluster headaches. The attacks have a circadian periodicity, happen most often at night, have a relapsing-remitting course, and have seasonal variation, all of which imply the involvement of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. The autonomic symptoms include conjunctival injection or lacrimation, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema or forehead/facial swelling, and miosis or ptosis.

Verapamil is the most widely prescribed preventative drug. It is recommended to do regular ECGs to monitor cardiac function when a patient is using this drug.

Other pharmacological options include lithium, oral steroids, valproic acid, melatonin, and intranasal capsaicin.",Verapamil,Ergotamine,Melatonin,Oral sumatriptan,paracetamol,A,"A. Verapamil Rationale:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with cluster headaches, which are characterized by severe, short-lasting headaches that often occur at the same time each day.

###Answer:",A,"Healthy intact bone is resistant to infection. Trauma, ischemia, or the presence of foreign bodies increase the risk of bone infections.

Certain bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, adhere to the bone by expressing receptors, called adhesins, to some components of the bone matrix, including laminin, collagen, fibronectin, and bone sialoglycoprotein.

S aureus expresses a collagen-binding adhesin, which permits its attachment to bone cartilage. Bacteria can also adhere to surgically implanted devices via fibronectin-binding adhesins.

S aureus can survive intracellularly after being internalized by cultured osteoblasts. Some bacteria create a protective biofilm coating around themselves and underlying surfaces such as prosthetic material.",Staphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas,Streptococcus,Escherichia coli,clamydia,A,"A.

A.  Intramuscular injection of epinephrine
B.  Intravenous hydrocortisone
C.  Topical mupirocin
D.  Intradermal hyaluronidase
E.  steroids

###Answer:",D,"The most concerning adverse effect of calcium gluconate is extravasation from intravenous sites. Calcium can induce tissue necrosis through calcium-induced vasoconstriction of capillaries and intracellular fluid retention, leading to deep tissue damage and late-onset calcifications (calcinosis cutis).

For extravasation injury treatment, stop the infusion and then gently aspirate the extravasated fluid. In early or acute calcium extravasation, a hyaluronidase antidote may be used in addition to cold, dry compresses and elevation of the extremity. 1 to 1.7 mL of hyaluronidase may be given intradermally into the border of the extravasated area as five separate injections. Injection into the catheter that caused the infiltration is also appropriate.

Calcium gluconate should be administered in large veins or via a central venous catheter to minimize the risk of extravasation injury.

Essential thrombocytosis, a type of myeloproliferative disorder, involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell. However, distinguishing it from more common nonclonal, reactive forms of thrombocytosis can be challenging as there is no reliable clonal marker. Only around 50% of patients with essential thrombocytosis carry the JAK2 V617F mutation. Hence, diagnosis typically relies on excluding other potential causes. Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis encompass infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other myeloproliferative disorders like chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis, along with myelodysplastic syndromes such as the 5q-syndrome, may also lead to thrombocytosis.

A.  Esophageal atresia.
B.  Duodenal atresia.
C.  Pyloric atresia.
D.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
E.  Hirschsprung's disease

###Answer:",D,"The correct answer is D.

Polyhydramnios, which refers to an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac during pregnancy, is frequently observed in various congenital anomalies that result in obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Let's analyze each option:

A. Esophageal atresia: Esophageal atresia, where the esophagus does not develop properly, can lead to polyhydramnios due to the inability of the fetus to swallow amniotic fluid.

B. Duodenal atresia: Duodenal atresia, a blockage in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), can cause polyhydramnios because the fetus is unable to process swallowed amniotic fluid properly.

C. Pyloric atresia: Pyloric atresia, a rare condition where there is a blockage at the outlet of the stomach (pylorus), can result in polyhydramnios due to the accumulation of swallowed amniotic fluid.

E. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia can cause compression of the fetal lungs, leading to inadequate lung development and reduced production of pulmonary surfactant. This can result in polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing and clearance of amniotic fluid.

Option D, Hirschsprung's disease, is not typically associated with polyhydramnios. Hirschsprung's disease involves the absence of nerve cells in the muscles of the colon, leading to difficulty passing stool. It is not directly related to obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract that would lead to polyhydramnios. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",Esophageal atresia.,Duodenal atresia.,Pyloric atresia.,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,Hirschsprung's disease,E,"E. Hirschsprung's disease Rationale:
Polyhydramnios is a condition in which there is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid.

A.  Toxic adenoma
B.  Toxic adenoma
C.  Subacute thyroiditis
D.  Subacute thyroiditis
E.  None

###Answer:",A,"Follicular adenomas usually present as solitary thyroid nodules. As part of routine assessment, baseline thyroid function tests are done.

A low TSH level should raise suspicion of toxic adenoma. These patients could have signs of hyperthyroidism like weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, and muscle tremors. If so, free T3 and T4 levels should be determined. If the patient is not euthyroid, prior medication must be provided to ensure a clinically euthyroid state. If not treated appropriately, surgical complications like a thyroid storm can occur.

In such cases, an Iodine-131 scan could help confirm the functional status of the nodule.

Infected thyroglossal cysts and subacute thyroiditis are unlikely as the patient has no history of fever, pain, or other symptoms. Moreover, a thyroglossal cyst is a congenital anomaly that could contain ectopic thyroid tissue. In this case, it is unlikely. Anaplastic carcinoma usually affects older people and is aggressive.

###Answer:",E,"Tumor lysis syndrome primarily affects individuals undergoing chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating malignancies, such as acute leukemias and Burkitts lymphoma, though it can rarely occur in chronic lymphomas or solid tumors. The syndrome arises due to the massive destruction of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in the release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This cascade leads to a characteristic metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is a common complication, potentially progressing to renal failure, especially if uric acid crystallizes within renal tubules, necessitating hemodialysis. Lactic acidosis and dehydration heighten the risk of acute kidney injury.

Which of the following is the most useful in differentiating hereditary spherocytosis from autoimmune hemolytic anemia?
###Options:
A.  Osmotic fragility test
B.  Bone marrow biopsy
C.  Direct Coomb's test
D.  LDH
E.  Haptoglobin

###Answer:",C,"Direct Coomb's test detects antibodies or complement proteins bound to the surface of red blood cells. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), the Direct Coomb's test is typically positive, indicating the presence of antibodies coating the patient's red blood cells.

###Options:
A.  Low amplitude ECG
B.  Electrical alternans
C.  Pulsus paradoxus
D.  Raised plasma lactate
E.  Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF

###Answer:",E,"The correct answer is E. A large pericardial effusion reduces the amplitude of the ECG as the myocardial tissue is further away from the recording electrodes. The heart may rotate within the pericardial sac so that there is a motion artefact on the ECG (electrical alternans). There may be an increased fall in blood pressure on inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) as the increased venous return to the right heart causes the septum to bulge into the left ventricle, impeding cardiac output. Concave ST elevation in a pattern that does not correspond to coronary ischaemia is typical of pericarditis, which may be complicated by pericardial tamponade. Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF is typical of an inferior myocardial infarction. Rarely this could lead to myocardial rupture and tamponade but would usually result in sudden death.",Low amplitude ECG,Electrical alternans,Pulsus paradoxus,Raised plasma lactate,"Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF",D,"D. Raised plasma lactate Rationale:
Raised plasma lactate is not a typical feature of cardiac tamponade. It is usually associated with tissue hypoperfusion and shock, but it is not specific to cardiac tamponade. The other options are all classic features of cardiac tamponade:  Low amplitude ECG: due to the fluid surrounding the heart attenuating the electrical signals.
 Electrical alternans: alternating amplitude of the QRS complexes due to the swinging motion of the heart within the fluid-filled pericardial sac.
 Pulsus paradoxus: a drop in systolic blood pressure of >10 mmHg during inspiration due to the increased pressure in the pericardial sac restricting cardiac filling.
 Convex ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF: due to the pericardial inflammation associated with the effusion.",False,model2

###Options:
A.  Myocardial rupture
B.  Limb loss
C.  Hypotension
D.  Bleeding complications
E.  Arrythmia

###Answer:",D,"The major and most feared complication of thrombolytic therapy is bleeding complications, most notably intracranial hemorrhage. Other complications include systemic hemorrhage, immunologic complications, hypotension, and myocardial rupture.

Fibrinogen levels must be monitored closely in patients undergoing thrombolysis to ensure they are above 150mg/dL. When levels drop below 150mg/dL, this poses a significant bleeding risk. Treatment includes reducing and stopping the infusion rate below 100mg/dL. Platelets and hemoglobin levels should also be monitored closely as well.

Hypotension is a known risk with ""reperfusion""; however, generally, this can be controlled with infusions and will ultimately resolve as the infusion is stopped and the patient is resuscitated adequately.

(E) Carcinoma Rationale: Dimpling of the skin on the breast, especially with raising of the arms, is a classic sign of underlying breast carcinoma. The dimpling is caused by the retraction of Cooper's ligaments, which are fibrous bands that connect the breast tissue to the skin. When a tumor invades these ligaments, it causes them to shorten and pull on the skin, creating the dimpled appearance. Other options such as pregnancy, weight gain, aging, and fibrocystic disease do not typically cause dimpling of the breast skin.",False,model2

His mother says he has experienced a gradual decline in his school performance over the last 6 months and has been acting differently. He recently underwent a drug test which came out negative for any known illicit drugs. He has also experienced weight loss of 11 lb (5 kg) and a gradually decreasing appetite. On examination, tremors are present in both upper extremities, and he is unable to write correctly. The tremors worsen when he is asked to reach for an object. An unsteady, broad-based gait is also observed. His serum transaminases are elevated, and low serum ceruloplasmin is found. The patient is placed on medication to treat his condition. How does this drug help to improve his underlying symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Prevents intestinal absorption of copper
B.  Increases the uptake of copper by the liver and prevents its accumulation in other tissues
C.  Eliminates the high ammonia causing his symptoms
D.  Chelates copper
E.  none

###Answer:",D,"This 16-year-old boy with a decline in school performance, changes in personality (acting differently), tremors, ataxia, elevated liver enzymes, and low ceruloplasmin likely has Wilson disease (also known as hepatolenticular degeneration). Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B, a gene on chromosome 13 that encodes for the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase. The primary source of copper for the body comes from the diet. Dietary copper intake is around 1-2 mg/day, and the daily requirement for copper is 0.75 mg/day; hence proper excretion of copper is crucial to prevent its accumulation in the tissues. Copper is mainly excreted into the bile and then excreted from the body in the feces.

The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase regulates the copper needed by the body and incorporates it into aceruloplasmin (ceruloplasmin without copper) to make ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin is then secreted into the bloodstream, and copper is utilized by the body (eg, iron metabolism). The hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase also secretes the excess copper into the bile. In Wilson disease, the hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase is dysfunctional, and thus there is deceased incorporation of copper into aceruloplasmin; thus, there will be low blood levels of ceruloplasmin (as in this patient) and decreased secretion of excess copper from the liver into the bile so that the copper will accumulate in the tissues.

In Wilson disease, copper especially accumulates in the liver (causing hepatitis, acute liver failure, cirrhosis), brain (dystonia, dysarthria, tremors, personality changes), the cornea (causing Kayser-Fleischer rings which are brown rings on the cornea due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane of the cornea), joints (arthritis, commonly in the knees), and kidneys (causing Fanconi syndrome). Diagnosis of Wilson disease is by clinical features suggesting Wilson disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit-lamp examination, low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated 24-hour-urine copper, abnormal liver enzymes, and ATP7B mutation analysis.

Treatment of Wilson disease is aimed at removing excess copper by using copper chelators. Penicillamine is the primary chelator used. It has a sulfhydryl group that binds to copper and secretes it through the urine. Trientine is used as a second-line copper chelator. Patients should also be advised to follow a low-copper diet.",Prevents intestinal absorption of copper,Increases the uptake of copper by the liver and prevents its accumulation in other tissues,Eliminates the high ammonia causing his symptoms,Chelates copper,none,D,"D. Chelates copper Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. The medication used to treat Wilson's disease, such as penicillamine or trientine, chelates copper, meaning it binds to copper and removes it from the body through urine. This helps to reduce copper accumulation and improve symptoms related to copper toxicity, such as tremors, difficulty walking, and cognitive decline.",True,model2

Over the past 24 hours, he has developed pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, and decreased urination. Laboratory results show a hematocrit of 28% and a platelet count of 72,000/¼L, along with blood and protein in the urine.
###Options:
A.  Henoch-Schönlein purpura
B.  IgA nephropathy
C.  Intussusception
D.  Meckel diverticulum
E.  Hemolytic-uremic syndrome

###Answer:",E,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome predominantly affects children under the age of 4 and is characterized by acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia due to increased platelet utilization, and renal insufficiency resulting from vascular endothelial injury and local fibrin deposition. This condition can lead to ischemic changes, causing renal cortical necrosis, as well as damage to other organs such as the colon, liver, heart, brain, and adrenal glands. Laboratory findings associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome include a low hemoglobin level, decreased platelet count, hypoalbuminemia, and evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear (such as burr cells, helmet cells, and schistocytes). Urinalysis typically reveals hematuria and proteinuria. A significant decline in renal function leads to oliguria and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction, ascites, and central nervous system symptoms like somnolence, convulsions, and coma may also occur.In recent years, infection with verotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 has been identified as a common cause of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. This strain of E. coli is prevalent in cattle and has been associated with outbreaks linked to undercooked contaminated hamburgers, as well as other food items like roast beef, cows milk, and fresh apple cider. It's worth noting that the Coombs test is not positive in this type of hemolytic anemia.Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that typically presents with a petechial-like rash on the lower extremities, although the platelet count remains normal. While microscopic blood in the stool or urine can occur, fever is uncommon, and colicky abdominal pain is a potential symptom.IgA nephropathy may cause hematuria, but it typically doesn't present with the other findings described in the case. Intussusception is a condition seen in children of this age group, but the absence of episodic colicky abdominal pain or emesis makes this diagnosis less likely.Meckel diverticulum can lead to painless bloody stool, but it doesn't usually cause fever or other associated symptoms like anuria.",Henoch-Schönlein purpura,IgA nephropathy,Intussusception,Meckel diverticulum,Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,E,"E. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome Rationale:
The child's symptoms of fever, bloody diarrhea, pallor, lethargy, facial swelling, decreased urination, low hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, and blood and protein in the urine are highly suggestive of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is typically caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection, often acquired through exposure to contaminated food or water, as may have occurred at the amusement park.",True,model2

###Answer:",B,Viral hepatitis is the most common cause worldwide. Hepatitis A is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route via the consumption of infected water or food. Risk factors of hepatitis A include travel to developing countries and the use of food from unclean sources.,Consumption of alcohol,Fecal-oral transmission,Needlestick injuries,Genital secretions,smoking,B,"B. Fecal-oral transmission Rationale:
The patient's presentation with fever, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes suggests acute hepatitis. The history of recent travel to India, a region with high hepatitis A prevalence, and the absence of other risk factors (e.g., alcohol use, needlestick injuries, sexual contact) strongly suggest that the most common mode of transmission in this case is fecal-oral transmission.

A.  Altered taste on anterior two-thirds of the tongue
B.  Altered taste on posterior one-thirds of the tongue
C.  Facial droop
D.  Abnormal voice pitch
E.  Decreased sensation of the jaw

###Answer:",D,"The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) innervates the posterior third of the tongue and can be damaged in surgeries involving the base of the tongue. It is a mixed nerve that carries afferent sensory and efferent motor information.

Lesions of the glossopharyngeal nerve produce difficulty swallowing, impairment of taste over the posterior one-third of the tongue, impaired sensation over the posterior one-third of the tongue, palate, and pharynx, an absent gag reflex, and dysfunction of the parotid gland.

The branches of the ninth cranial nerve include the tympanic, stylopharyngeal, tonsillar, nerve to carotid sinus, branches to the posterior third of the tongue, lingual branches, and a communicating branch to the vagus nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve contributes to the formation of the pharyngeal plexus along with the vagus nerve.

The 5 functions of the glossopharyngeal nerve are 1) branchial motor, special visceral efferent, supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle and superior constrictor muscle, 2) visceral motor, general visceral efferent, provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland via the otic ganglion, 3) visceral sensory, general visceral afferent, carries visceral sensory information from the carotid body and carotid sinus, 4) general sensory, general somatic afferent, provides general sensory information from the inner surface of the tympanic membrane, upper pharynx, and the posterior one-third of the tongue and 5) visceral afferent, special visceral afferent, provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, including circumvallate papillae.

This can lead to the following potential complications:  Altered taste on anterior two-thirds of the tongue: The chorda tympani nerve, which carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, runs near the base of the tongue and may be damaged during surgery.
 Altered taste on posterior one-thirds of the tongue: The glossopharyngeal nerve, which carries taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, may also be damaged during surgery.
 Abnormal voice pitch: The hypoglossal nerve, which innervates the muscles of the tongue, may be damaged during surgery, leading to changes in voice pitch.
 Decreased sensation of the jaw: The lingual nerve, which provides sensation to the tongue and floor of the mouth, may be damaged during surgery, resulting in decreased sensation in the jaw. Facial droop is not a potential complication of this surgery, as the facial nerve is not located in the surgical field.",False,model2

After the fall, a sudden headache developed. The patient describes this headache as the worst of his life. Since the fall, the patient has also experienced vomiting. Given that he may have a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a non-contrast CT of his head is done. The CT is negative. To completely rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a lumbar puncture is performed. If the patient does have a subarachnoid hemorrhage, what finding would most likely be expected from the analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?
###Options:
A.  Xanthochromia
B.  Oligoclonal bands
C.  Elevated protein
D.  Red blood cells, with the greatest concentration in the first tube
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a leakage of blood into the subarachnoid space. The cause is most often traumatic, such as blunt trauma or a fall. The second most common cause is aneurysm rupture.

The great majority of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage experience a sudden onset headache that is described as a ""thunderclap"" or the ""worst headache of my life"".

Diagnosis is usually achieved by a non-contrast CT, but as time since the incident increases, the sensitivity of the CT decreases. To completely rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a lumbar puncture is recommended.

CSF analysis of a patient with a new subarachnoid hemorrhage should show positive erythrocytes evenly in tubes 1 through 4. A traumatic spinal tap should be suspected when the concentration of erythrocytes is greatest in the first tube. Xanthochromia is a yellow-orange discoloration of CSF that may be present if the subarachnoid hemorrhage is subacute.

He suddenly complains of severe chest pain. His blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and his heart rate is 65/min. Auscultation reveals no murmurs or rubs. An ECG reveals sinus rhythm with an acute ST-segment elevation in the anteroseptal area. Urgent bedside echocardiography showed anteroseptal, lateral, and apical akinesis, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and severe pericardial effusion. Within 20 minutes he is unconscious with undetectable pulses and blood pressure. What is the most likely cause of the patients sudden decompensation?
###Options:
A.  Free wall rupture
B.  Left ventricular thrombus
C.  Mitral regurgitation
D.  Pericarditis
E.  Ventricular septal rupture

###Answer:",A," The correct answer is A. Myocardial rupture is a sudden postinfarction complication that typically occurs 510 days postmyocardial infarction (peak at 7 days). During this time, the integrity of the cardiac wall is compromised by macrophage and mononuclear infiltration, fibrovascular response, and other inflammatory mediators, as they replace necrotic tissue with scar tissue. Old age, first infarction, and a history of hypertension are risk factors. The clinical manifestations, as depicted here, are a sudden loss of heart rate, blood pressure, and consciousness, while the ECG continues to show a sinus rhythm. Measures to prevent cardiac rupture include the administration of ²blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the avoidance of steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen and indomethacin.",Free wall rupture,Left ventricular thrombus,Mitral regurgitation,Pericarditis,Ventricular septal rupture,A,"A. Free wall rupture Rationale: Free wall rupture is a catastrophic complication of myocardial infarction that typically occurs within the first week after the event. The patient's presentation with sudden severe chest pain, hypotension, and rapid deterioration with loss of consciousness is highly suggestive of free wall rupture.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia and rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization. This can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

clinical problems?
 


###Options:
A.  Infection
B.  Airway obstruction
C.  Hemorrhage
D.  Malignant degeneration
E.  Pain

###Answer:",A,"The correct answer is a. Infection.

Branchial cleft remnants are congenital anomalies that can persist as cysts, sinuses, or fistulas due to incomplete closure of the branchial clefts during embryonic development. These remnants can become sites for the accumulation of debris and colonization by bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. Infection is the most common clinical problem associated with branchial cleft remnants, presenting as localized swelling, erythema, tenderness, and sometimes purulent drainage.

Options b, c, d, and e are less commonly associated with branchial cleft remnants:

b. Airway obstruction: While large branchial cleft cysts or fistulas may compress adjacent structures, leading to airway obstruction in rare cases, it is not the most common presentation.

c. Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage from branchial cleft remnants is uncommon and typically occurs secondary to trauma or inflammation rather than being a primary clinical problem.

d. Malignant degeneration: Malignant transformation of branchial cleft remnants is rare but can occur, typically presenting as a painless mass rather than infection.

e. Pain: Pain may occur if there is acute infection or inflammation of the branchial cleft remnant, but it is not the most common presentation.

He was potty trained at three years of age. He has met all his developmental milestones. However, he does not have regular bowel movements. His parents, who are the primary caregivers, seem quite appropriately concerned. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?
###Options:
A.  Abdominal x-ray
B.  Abdominal scan
C.  Serology markers for celiac disease
D.  Physical exam
E.  Ask more questions about possible abuse

###Answer:",D,"DSM -5 defines Encopresis or fecal incontinence as involuntary passing of stool into inappropriate places such as the underwear in children older than four years of age. There is at least one episode of encopresis each month for the last three months. These behaviors are not related to any other medical condition or substance-related or medications( laxative use/abuse).

The most common types of encopresis are; 1. Retentive encopresis - which is due to constipation and overflow incontinence.2. Non-retentive encopresis - inappropriate soiling without evidence of fecal constipation and retention.

Therefore, a thorough physical exam is necessary to investigate for fecal impaction.

While abdomen x-ray might confirm fecal impaction and overflow encopresis, it is not necessary most of the time because history and physical exam are adequate. Celiac disease can cause both diarrhea and constipation. Child abuse can lead to encopresis and should be investigated for appropriately in the presence of correct settings.

###Options:
A.  Benzodiazepine therapy
B.  Calcium channel blockers
C.  Daily exercise and weight reduction
D.  Beta-blockers
E.  alpha-blockers

###Answer:",B,"Prinzmetal or variant angina is severe chest pain due to spasms of an epicardial coronary artery. It is more often diagnosed in younger patients who smoke cigarettes.

Calcium channel blockers play an important role in the management of vasospastic angina. They are the first-line treatment due to a vasodilation effect in the coronary vasculature. Calcium antagonists are effective in alleviating symptoms in 90% of the patients. Moreover, one study demonstrated that the use of calcium channel blocker therapy was an independent predictor of myocardial infarct-free survival in vasospastic angina.

The use of a long-acting calcium antagonist is recommended, preferably at bedtime. A high dose of a long-acting calcium antagonist like diltiazem, amlodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil is recommended, and titration should be done on an individual basis with adequate response and minimal side effects.

Beta-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of vasospastic angina due to beta-2 adrenergic receptor blockade that increases the vasoconstriction in the arteries generating worsening of symptoms of vasospasm.",Benzodiazepine therapy,Calcium channel blockers,Daily exercise and weight reduction,Beta-blockers,alpha-blockers,B,"B.

This condition is characterized by coronary artery spasm, which causes chest pain typically at rest and often at night. Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem or nifedipine, are the mainstay of treatment for Prinzmetal's angina as they relax the smooth muscle in the coronary arteries, preventing spasm. The other options are not appropriate treatments for Prinzmetal's angina:  Benzodiazepines are anxiolytics and may not be effective in preventing coronary spasm.

She describes the pain as sharp, constant, and aggravated by movement. She has no bowel or urinary symptoms and no previous abdominal problems. Her first-degree cousin died of colorectal carcinoma at a young age. Her vital signs were blood pressure 137/89 mmHg, pulse 96/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 100.6 F (38.1 C). Physical examination was unremarkable except for a mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa. A complete blood count (CBC) showed leukocytosis with the left shift. Urine HCG is negative. Which of the following is the next best step in managing this patient?
###Options:
A.  Ultrasound abdomen
B.  Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen
C.  Plain CT abdomen
D.  Proceed for laparoscopic appendectomy
E.  MRI of abdomen

###Answer:",A,"This patient is most likely suffering from acute appendicitis with the features suggestive of this diagnosis, such as peri-umbilical pain that later localizes towards the right lower quadrant. Examination findings of fever, tachycardia, and mild right iliac fossa tenderness are usually diagnostic.

Her husband reports that her neurological symptoms began shortly after she started the new medication. The patient is usually very active and she can no longer participate in her daily walks. She follows a strict vegan diet and she does not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. Which of the following factors most likely participated in the patients worsening neurologic symptoms?
###Options:
A.  Concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency
B.  Tumor lysis syndrome
C.  Global cerebral hypoperfusion
D.  Inflammatory demyelination syndrome
E.  Concurrent vitamin B9 deficiency

###Answer:",A,"In patients with vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia, the treatment of megaloblastic anemia with folate alone may cause a progression in neurologic symptoms.

Hematologic improvement may occur in patients receiving folate therapy who also have a vitamin B12 deficiency. Thus, it is especially important to be sure that there is no other underlying cause of the patient's megaloblastic anemia.

As lab work may be improving, neurologic deficits may be worsening, and can even become permanent. IV folinic acid is FDA approved for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia in patients who do not have a vitamin B12 deficiency and in whom oral therapy is not possible.

###Options:
A.  Elevated transaminases
B.  Hyponatremia
C.  Elevated serum IgE
D.  Presence of cold agglutinins
E.  Elevated serum IgG

###Answer:",D,"This patient has a picture of atypical pneumonia, mostly caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Patient symptoms are typically more significant than objective findings on physical exam. Disease onset is gradual, and patients can initially complain of headaches and low-grade fever. A nagging cough is usually the most prominent respiratory feature. Physical examination findings are often minimal. Chest auscultation can be normal even if pneumonia is present.

There are no specific clinical or radiological findings in mycoplasma pneumonia that can differentiate it from other causes of atypical pneumonia. When available, PCR can be done rapidly and is the test of choice. Testing for cold agglutinins can sometimes support a clinical diagnosis when a rapid diagnosis must be made. M. pneumoniae lacks a cell wall and is fastidious; therefore, gram stains and cultures are not useful for the diagnosis of these organisms.

Hemolysis is found in the majority of patients with pneumonia and causes a positive Coomb test and an elevated reticulocyte count. Cold agglutinin titers are elevated in more than 50% of patients with mycoplasma disease.

C.  Clinical symptoms and signs
D.  CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
E.  CT brain

###Answer:",D,"The most sensitive and specific way to diagnose Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is to do an HSV PCR in CSF. HSV PCR has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94 to 100%. HSV PCR could be false negative in the initial 72 hours and needs to be repeated after 3 to 7 days if the suspicion is high. RBCs in the CSF can also give a false negative test.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be type 1 or type 2. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of life-threatening sporadic encephalitis worldwide. It causes encephalitis in adults and children beyond the neonatal age. Neonatal herpes encephalitis could be either due to type 1 or type 2, the latter being more common.

Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults. A high index of suspicion, rapid diagnostic workups, and early diagnosis with early initiation of acyclovir can further improve morbidity and mortality.

Clinical signs and symptoms are highly non-specific. Immunocompromised or elderly can have atypical or subtle presentations. Cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes could be easily misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. Classic radiologic features that have been described include asymmetric involvement of the limbic system, abnormalities in the inferior medial temporal lobes and inferolateral frontal lobes, and the insular cortices. Diffusion-weighted MRI with flair sequences is 90% sensitive in detecting changes in HSE (herpes simplex encephalitis). CT can detect changes only in half to two-thirds of patients.

This is because excessive uterine bleeding in a patient with uterine leiomyomata could be due to endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma. An endometrial biopsy will help in evaluating the endometrial lining and determining the cause of the bleeding. Myomectomy and hysterectomy are surgical options that may be considered later depending on the biopsy results. Ultrasonography and hysterosalpingography may provide additional information but are not the next step in management.,Myomectomy,Hysterectomy,Ultrasonography,Endometrial biopsy,Hysterosalpingography,C,"C.

the reception room is:


###Options:
A.  Control of active bleeding.
B.  Taking blood sample for grouping and cross matching.
C.  Establishing an intravenous line.
D.  Securing clear airway and adequate pulmonary ventilation.
E.  providing tetanus prophylaxis.

###Answer:",D,"Correct Answer: D
In the management of a severely injured patient in the reception room, securing a clear airway and ensuring adequate pulmonary ventilation is the most urgent measure. This is because airway compromise and inadequate breathing can quickly lead to life-threatening situations, such as hypoxia or respiratory arrest. Without proper oxygenation and ventilation, other interventions, such as controlling bleeding or administering medications, may be ineffective or futile. Therefore, ensuring the patient's ability to breathe is the top priority in the initial management of trauma patients.

He has a history of asthma, for which he takes inhaled corticosteroids once a day. He returned from a 3-day camping trip five days ago and was alright throughout the trip. He has a smoking history of 15-pack-years and a history of alcohol consumption of 20 years and consumes around 15 drinks/week. He has a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin for the last 30 years. Laboratory investigations reveal a hemoglobin of 16.9 g/dL, ESR of 30 mm, blood glucose 150 mg/dL, WBC count of 14000/µL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen is 10 mg/dL, total bilirubin is 2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin is 0.3 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL and platelet levels of 500000/µL. Physical examination reveals scratch marks over the body. There is no evidence of icterus, but splenomegaly is present. What is the probable diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Mast cell activation syndrome
B.  Uremia
C.  Polycythemia vera
D.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis
E.  Tuberculosis

###Answer:",C,"This patient with a history of incessant itching and burning over the body especially in the mornings, and a raised WBC count, platelet count, and splenomegaly, and a smoking history of 15-pack-years, is probably a case of polycythemia vera. The association of itching with mornings is probably due to a hot water shower owing to the cold temperatures in Atlanta. This is also known as aquagenic pruritus. Management of pruritus is an avoidance of the trigger, especially hot water. Antihistamines and topical moisturizers may help. Aspirin also helps in alleviating pruritus.

Peripheral blood smear in pre-polycythemic and overt polycythemic stage shows normochromic and normocytic RBCs, erythrocytosis with elevated hemoglobin (greater than 16.5 g/dL in male and 16.0 g/dL in female), leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. However, in concomitant iron deficiency, smear shows a microcytic and hypochromic picture. In the post-polycythemic myelofibrosis stage, blood smear is characterized by leukoerythroblastosis, with teardrop-shaped RBCs and poikilocytosis.

Janus kinase gene is a type of protein kinase which phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in the JAK-STAT pathway, and activation of this pathway results in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The JAK2 mutation is found in about 70% of MPNs. It is a somatic mutation that involves the substitution of valine to phenylalanine at codon 617 (JAK2 V617F) in the pseudokinase domain. The frequency of JAK2 V617F mutation is 95% in patients with PV.

Mast cell activation syndrome involves a positive family history and is unrelated to hot water exposure. Uremia is unlikely in this patient with mildly elevated creatinine and normal BUN. Primary sclerosing cholangitis can present with pruritis and in severe cases splenomegaly secondary to cirrhosis but would present with raised bilirubin levels with a high direct bilirubin component, and pruritus unrelated to hot water exposure, making this diagnosis less likely.

The most appropriate investigation would be:
###Options:
A.  Low-dose dexamethasone test
B.  High-dose dexamethasone test
C.  Urinary catecholamines
D.  Computed tomography (CT) scan
E.  Urinary free cortisol measurement

###Answer:",E,"The patient appears to be suffering from cushingoid symptoms. After a history to exclude causes such as high-dose steroid intake, the main differential diagnoses include an adrenal tumour, an ectopic tumour producing ACTH (Cushings syndrome) or a pituitary tumour (Cushings disease). Although a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level measurement (E) does not confirm the exact diagnosis, it does indicate if there is a pathological excess of cortisol (levels can vary up to 700nmol/L in the morning to 280nmol/L at midnight). A low dose (0.5mg) dexamethasone test (A) involves measuring ACTH after dexamethasone administration. In Cushings disease and syndrome, there is no suppression of ACTH. A high- dose dexamethasone test (B) will differentiate between Cushings disease and Cushings syndrome since only in the former is there suppressed ACTH production after high-dose dexamethasone administration. A CT scan (D) can be used to identify a pituitary tumour if requiring surgical management. Urinary catecholamine (C) measurement is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal tumour producing excess catecholamines measurable in the urine. Differentiating an adrenal tumour producing excess cortisol can be done by administering metyrapone, an 11-² hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, which effectively ceases adrenal cortisol production.

B.  Double the dose of his proton pump inhibitor and schedule him for follow-up in 4 weeks
C.  Perform an esophagoscopy
D.  Schedule him for elective esophagectomy
E.  Schedule him for emergent Nissen fundoplication

###Answer:",C,"The correct answer is C. A one-timeesophagoscopy is recommended in patients 50years or older to evaluate for the developmentof esophageal metaplasia (Barretts esophagus).There is a direct correlation between the development of Barretts esophagus and history ofgastroesophageal reflux disease. If metaplasia ispresent, these patients are 30 to 125 timesmore likely to develop adenocarcinoma. Anesophagoscopy and biopsy could help discernwhether this patient has a Barretts esophagusor has already progressed to an early stage cancer that has yet to cause dysphagia and weightloss.Answer A is incorrect. Although doubling themedication dose may provide symptomatic relief of the gastroesophageal reflux disease, itdoes not tell us anything about the damagethat has been done to the esophagus as a resultof the condition. To properly manage the disease, it is necessary to evaluate for metaplasia.Answer B is incorrect. Changing the medication dose may provide further symptomatic relief of the gastroesophageal reflux disease, butthis patient is in need of an esophagoscopy toevaluate for metaplasia in order to properlymanage the disease.Answer D is incorrect. Esophagectomy is typically indicated for the removal of long segments of metaplasia in patients with Barrettsesophagus.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, for which he takes 5-aminosalicylic acid and infliximab as prescribed. He smokes a two-pack of cigarettes daily for the past four yearsno history of alcohol use. The patient has noticed the loosening of old clothes. Temperature is 38.1 C (100 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 80 beats per minute. On physical examination, the patient appears tired, the skin seems jaundiced, and there is mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no abdominal mass appreciated on abdominal palpation. Bowel sounds are normal. There is no history of recent travel, unprotected sexual intercourse, or intravenous drug use. Abdominal ultrasound reveals no abnormality. Laboratory results show bilirubin total of 12.3 mg/dl and bilirubin direct of 8.9 mg/dl. Anti-mitochondrial (AMA) antibodies are negative. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed, which shows multiple strictures in the biliary system and a mass arising from the biliary tract epithelium. A biopsy is taken. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor to the patients condition?
###Options:
A.  Medication
B.  Smoking
C.  Age
D.  History of inflammatory bowel disease
E.  None

###Answer:",D,"Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with chronic inflammation and irritation that put the biliary tract epithelium under stress to modify and undergo malignant changes.

The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography shows strictures of the bile duct, which diagnose primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is a characteristic feature of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, a risk factor for the biliary tract carcinoma.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a mass originating from the biliary tract epithelium, which confirms the diagnosis of biliary tract carcinoma in the presence of distinct risk factors.

The patient has symptoms of obstructive jaundice in the presence of a known risk factor that causes the epithelium of the biliary tract to undergo malignant changes.",Medication,Smoking,Age,History of inflammatory bowel disease,,D,"D. History of inflammatory bowel disease Rationale: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis is therefore the most likely predisposing factor to his condition.

The physical evaluation finds evidence of a stiff neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?
###Options:
A.  Administer a triptan and discharge with a plan of lab analysis in 24 hours.
B.  Administer dexamethasone and perform a lumbar puncture.
C.  Administer ketorolac and perform a brain CAT scan.
D.  Administer a triptan and ketorolac, and perform an electroencephalogram.
E.  None

###Answer:",C,"NSAIDs are one of the first-line treatments for acute migraine attacks and other acute headaches. Neuroimaging is indicated in this patient for a first or worst episode, abnormal neurologic examination (such as a stiff neck), and new episodes in older patients (more than 50 years old).

Other neuroimaging indications could be other neurological symptoms or signs (confusion, neck, papilledema, epilepsy), non-typical characteristics, resistance to treatment, immunosuppressed patients, and systemic or meningeal signs or symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue).

Typically brain CT scan (with or without contrast) is sufficient as a primary neuroimaging method. However, other methods can be used, such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, or venography.

Discharging the patient would not be the best option because of the great suspicion of a secondary headache. Dexamethasone is not a single first-line option, and lumbar punction should preferably be made after neuroimaging.

An epidural is placed and functions well. The patient suddenly develops severe abdominal pain, which she describes to her nurse as a tearing sensation. External maternal-fetal monitoring, which has been Category I, shows a sudden drop in the fetal heart rate to 50 bpm. The maternal heart rate jumps to 130 bpm and her blood pressure is now 90/50 mm Hg. The patient is brought to the operating room for an emergent cesarean birth. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this event?
###Options:
A.  Mechanical cervical dilation with oxytocin administration
B.  Multiparity
C.  Trial of labor after cesarean birth
D.  Advanced maternal age
E.  Blood pressure

###Answer:",C,"This patient has signs and symptoms concerning for uterine rupture: fetal bradycardia, sudden-onset severe abdominal pain that is not masked by an epidural, and maternal hemodynamic instability. Another key finding often present is a loss of fetal station.

The biggest risk factor for uterine rupture is a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). The incidence of uterine rupture in an unscarred uterus is roughly 1 rupture per 10,000 to 25,000 deliveries. The incidence of uterine rupture for women in labor with 1 previous cesarean delivery is approximately 0.3% to 1%. The incidence increases in patients with more than 1 cesarean birth, though the exact increase is somewhat unclear; estimates range from 0.9% to nearly 4%.

The study cited in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin noted the risk of uterine rupture was 0.9% and 1.8% in women with 1 versus 2 prior cesarean births. ACOG notes that a TOLAC is reasonable to offer appropriately selected well-counseled patients with 2 prior cesarean births.

The risk of uterine rupture is slightly higher in women of advanced maternal age who undergo a TOLAC compared to younger women. Multiparty and induction of labor are also risk factors for uterine rupture. These risk factors have a much smaller effect on the rate of uterine rupture, however, than a TOLAC.Of note, the use of misoprostol is contraindicated in patients undergoing TOLAC due to a significant increase in uterine rupture risk. For this reason, mechanical dilation and oxytocin are recommended over prostaglandins in parturients requiring induction or augmentation while undergoing a TOLAC.

E.  none

###Answer:",A,"This woman is most likely presenting with a pituitary prolactinoma. Prolactinomas present with elevated prolactin levels and decreased levels of FSH and LH. This is due to negative feedback from the increased prolactin. Prolactinomas commonly cause amenorrhea and galactorrhea, like in this patient. A serum level of prolactin should be elevated, and an MRI will reveal a tumor. In the evaluation of a prolactinoma, a serum TSH level must be done as hyperprolactinemia can be caused by an elevated thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).

Prolactinomas are benign pituitary tumors of the lactotroph cells, resulting in hypersecretion of prolactin. In premenopausal women, common presenting symptoms include amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, and decreased libido. Prolactinomas that are large can also cause compression of the optic nerve and cause visual disturbances, such as blurry vision, loss of vision, and bitemporal hemianopsia with compression at the level of the optic chiasm.

Men exhibit decreased libido and headaches.

Treatment is aimed at decreasing the size of the tumor with dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. These medications can suppress prolactin secretion.

This patient is experiencing cholinergic toxicity. This can commonly come in the form of organophosphate poisoning through pesticide exposure.

Sometimes exposures will be more apparent when several patients present with similar symptoms. It is easy to extract that those patients may have suffered exposure to the same toxin/substance. Early recognition of the exposure is important for early treatment and improved mortality. Getting the information about the patient's job and if anyone else has similar symptoms may cue the physician into organophosphate exposure and cholinergic toxicity as a result.

The differential diagnoses associated with cholinergic toxicity are long and difficult to differentiate. Obtaining a reliable history will aid tremendously and point the physician in the right direction of the correct diagnosis. The history is the most crucial portion of the initial evaluation for any exposure/toxicity.

###Options:
A.  chronic pancreatitis
B.  Crohn's disease
C.  Celiac sprue
D.  Whipple disease
E.  ulcerative colitis

###Answer:",C,"The patient has chronic diarrhea superimposed on a long history of loose stools, steatorrhea, and significant weight loss. While these features could be seen in several diseases, the presence of the pruritic vesiculopapular lesions on his extensor surfaces makes the diagnosis highly likely to be celiac sprue, with its frequently accompanying skin manifestation  dermatitis herpetiformis. Crohns disease is not usually associated with steatorrhea, and ulcerative colitis is often associated with bloody stools. Chronic pancreatitis and Whipple disease could cause a similar clinical picture but would not have the associated skin findings. A small bowel biopsy would confirm histopathologic features consistent with celiac sprue, such as villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia.  A small bowel biopsy could also diagnose or rule out Whipple disease by looking for the pathognomonic PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) positive organism  Tropheryma whippelii. Colonic biopsies would be unhelpful in celiac sprue.  A fecal fat quantification would likely confirm and assess the degree of steatorrhea, but would offer little other diagnostic information.  A small bowel x-ray is too nonspecific to confirm the diagnosis and an abdominal CT scan would likely be normal unless the patient had developed a complication of advanced sprue, such as intestinal lymphoma. Patients with celiac sprue are at increased risk for malignancies of the small bowel with adenocarcinoma and lymphoma being the two most commonly encountered. Patients with celiac sprue are not at greatly increased risk of the other malignancies listed. Limited data suggest that strict adherence to a glutenfree diet may decrease the incidence of malignancy in these patients.",chronic pancreatitis,Crohn's disease,Celiac sprue,Whipple disease,ulcerative colitis,C,"C. Celiac sprue Rationale: The patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, greasy stools, abdominal pain, and skin lesions are highly suggestive of celiac sprue. The glossitis, angular cheilosis, and skin lesions are due to vitamin deficiencies commonly seen in celiac sprue. The patient's history of loose stools for many years is also consistent with the diagnosis.

He recently traveled to South America to meet a friend who is a farmer. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse 80/min, respirations 16/min, and temperature 98.0 F (36.7 C). On examination, the patient has a symmetric abdomen, with localized tenderness over the right upper quadrant on light and deep palpation, without rebound or guarding. CT scan reveals numerous cysts in the patients liver. Which of the following serious adverse effects is the patient at risk for developing?
###Options:
A.  Anaphylaxis
B.  Blindness
C.  Seizures
D.  Intestinal ulceration
E.  Severe Headaches

###Answer:",A,"This patient, with a 2-week history of pain in the right upper quadrant, swelling in the abdomen, and chest pain, who recently traveled to South America and was exposed to livestock, is most likely infected with Echinococcus granulosus. Echinococcus granulosus infections cause cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatidosis. Hydatidosis results from a larval infection of the tapeworm (cestode) Echinococcus granulosus. The disease characteristically demonstrates the growth of hydatid cysts (metacestode) in internal organs (including the liver) of intermediate hosts. The definitive hosts of the cestode are carnivores such as dogs. Humans and other hosts ingest eggs or gravid proglottids that are excreted in the definitive host's feces, causing the infection.

A serious adverse effect that may result from rupture hydatid cysts is anaphylaxis. Treatment for Echinococcus granulosus is the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) procedure. This procedure is an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive modality used in hepatic and other abdominal cysts. Indications include inoperable patients, relapsing cases after surgery, and failure to respond to medical treatment. It provides the best results in CE1, and CE3a cysts over 5cm and is used in combination with medical therapy (BMZ). It is contraindicated in for CE2, CE3b, CE4, and CE5 cysts. Physicians performing this procedure must be equipped to deal with the potential anaphylactic shock. Other percutaneous treatment can be used, but are usually reserved for CE2 and CE3b cysts.

In symptomatic patients, one has to remove the entire cyst without rupture. One should never attempt to aspirate hydatid cysts because of the risk of cyst rupture and anaphylaxis. Lung may have to be resected if the underlying parenchyma has been damaged. To kill cysts, one can instill hypertonic saline in the cyst at the time of enucleation.

In addition to the risk for anaphylaxis, the rupture of the cyst, whether spontaneous or traumatic, can cause site-specific complications. Rupture of liver cysts into the biliary tree can result in biliary obstruction, superinfection of the cyst, and secondary peritonitis, while rupture of the lung cysts into the bronchial tree can result in pneumonitis, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and secondary pleuritis.",Anaphylaxis,Blindness,Seizures,Intestinal ulceration,Severe Headaches,A,"A. Anaphylaxis Rationale:
The patient's symptoms and CT findings are consistent with hydatid disease, a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that can occur if a hydatid cyst ruptures, releasing its contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face and throat, which can be life-threatening.",True,model2

###Options:
A.  Necrotising enterocolitis
B.  Situs inversus
C.  Cystic fibrosis
D.  Morgagni hernia
E.  Bochdalek hernia

###Answer:",E,"Bochdalek herniaA Bochdalek hernia is one of two forms of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the other form being Morgagni hernia. A Bochdalek hernia is a congenital abnormality in which an opening exists in the infants diaphragm, allowing normally intra-abdominal organs (particularly the stomach and intestines) to protrude into the thoracic cavity. In the majority of patients, the affected lung will be deformed, and the resulting lung compression can be life-threatening. Bochdalek hernias occur more commonly on the posterior left side (85%, versus right side 15%).In normal Bochdalek hernia cases, the symptoms are often observable simultaneously with the babys birth. A few of the symptoms of a Bochdalek Hernia include difficulty breathing, fast respiration and increased heart rate. Also, if the baby appears to have cyanosis (blue-tinted skin) this can also be a sign. Another way to differentiate a healthy baby from a baby with Bochdalek Hernia, is to look at the chest immediately after birth. If the baby has a Bochdalek Hernia it may appear that one side of the chest cavity is larger than the other and or the abdomen seems to be scaphoid (caved in).Situs inversus (also called situs transversus or oppositus) is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as situs solitus while situs inversus is generally the mirror image of situs solitus.",Necrotising enterocolitis,Situs inversus,Cystic fibrosis,Morgagni hernia,Bochdalek hernia,E,"E. Bochdalek hernia Rationale:
A Bochdalek hernia is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia that typically presents with respiratory compromise in the newborn.

C.  Vaccination should be administered two weeks post-splenectomy.
D.  The likelihood of infection post-splenectomy rises over time.
E.  Staphylococcus aureus is the primary organism associated with postsplenectomy sepsis.

###Answer:",A,"Splenectomy increases the likelihood of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, a severe infection with a high mortality rate. The main culprits are encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and occasionally gram-negative enteric organisms. Viral infections do not pose an elevated risk. Vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis is recommended for all potential splenectomy candidates, ideally administered at least 2 weeks before surgery. Younger patients, under 20 years old, face the highest risk due to the spleen's role in primary immunity and their increased exposure to these organisms. The risk peaks within the first 3 years post-surgery but persists at a lower level throughout life.",There is no heightened risk of viral infection following splenectomy.,Individuals over 50 who undergo splenectomy face the highest risk of postsplenectomy sepsis.,Vaccination should be administered two weeks post-splenectomy.,The likelihood of infection post-splenectomy rises over time.,Staphylococcus aureus is the primary organism associated with postsplenectomy sepsis.,D,"D. The likelihood of infection post-splenectomy rises over time. Rationale:
The spleen plays a vital role in the immune system, particularly in fighting encapsulated bacteria. After splenectomy, the risk of infection from these bacteria increases, and this risk gradually rises over time as the body's immune system may become less effective in combating these infections. The other options are incorrect: viral infections are also a risk, individuals of all ages face an increased risk, vaccination should be administered before or at least two weeks after splenectomy, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism associated with postsplenectomy sepsis.",False,model2

A.  Alcohol abuse
B.  Cigarette smoking
C.  Iatrogenic
D.  Infection

###Answer:",D," The correct answer is D. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is a cause of type B, or antral dominant, chronic gastritis. The most common cause of chronic type B gastritis is use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but our patient lacks this history. The incidence of chronic gastritis increases with age and the histologic appearance improves with the treatment of H. pylori. Symptoms of chronic gastritis may include pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, this condition is frequently asymptomatic. Diagnosis is confirmed by H. pylori antibody test and breath urease test, as well as a direct gastric biopsy and culture. Treatment of H. pylori gastritis is with triple therapy, which includes two antibiotics (metronidazole and clarithromycin), bismuth compound, and a proton pump inhibitor. Type A gastritis is autoimmune-mediated, affecting the fundus, and is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.",Alcohol abuse,Cigarette smoking,Iatrogenic,Infection,Spicy foods,D,D.

He states that the wound has been present for several months. They have been treating it at home with local wound care, including sterile bandages and antibiotic ointment, without resolution. He notes that he has had previous wounds at this location, which have healed in the past, but this one has not. He denies systemic symptoms but admits having trouble getting around, as his feet and lower legs get painful with walking. On physical exam, there is rubor less than 2 cm around the border, trace serous drainage in the wound, a fibrotic base, and a thickened, raised border, and the area is tender to palpation. There is limited bleeding on debridement due to the fibrotic base's thickened nature. The patient's pulse is faint, and the skin on the feet is atrophic and dry. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment following this appointment?
###Options:
A.  Referral for diabetic management and follow-up blood glucose
B.  Weekly wound care with debridements, wound vac placement, and biological skin substitute placement
C.  Vascular workup with arterial Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index
D.  Wound punch biopsy to be sent for pathology
E.  Antibiotics

###Answer:",C,"While the patient has not been well controlled in their diabetic management, which may be the cause of their nonhealing wound, the immediate concern is the vascular status.

The patient has been treated with conservative measures, which, though rudimentary, should have likely shown some improvement over time. Therefore, there is likely an underlying problem that has yet to be addressed. More advanced wound care modalities may provide the necessary environment for healing, but if the vascular issue is not addressed, they will likely fail.

The history includes MI, generally caused by atherosclerosis, which can also manifest in the extremities. The complaint of pain with walking and claudication suggests impaired vascular supply.

He has been feeling unwell for the past 3 weeks, with fevers, headaches and tiredness. His mother is concerned that he has been getting worse over time instead of better. He looks very pale and has many bruises and petechiae on his arms and legs, which have appeared spontaneously over the past week. Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged liver and spleen. An urgent full blood count shows: haemoglobin 68g/L (normal 120-180), platelets 25 (normal 150-450), white cell count 83 (normal 3.4-11.0). What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?
###Options:
A.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
B.  Aplastic anaemia
C.  Epstein-Barr virus
D.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
E.  Lymphoma

###Answer:",A,"This is a presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This boy is anaemic and thrombocytopenic, which together suggests a problem in the bone marrow. The high white cell count, fevers, headaches and hepatosplenomegaly point towards leukaemia. Aplastic anaemia would cause a low white cell count. ITP would cause low platelets, but the boy would otherwise be well. Although lymphoma could cause a high WCC, lymphadenopathy would be expected.

Shehas chronic atrial fibrillation and underwent placement of a prosthetic mitral valve 4 years ago. Her pulse is 120/minand irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Arteriography shows an embolus in the superiormesenteric artery lodged just beyond the patent middle colic artery. A laparotomy is done. During this procedure, whichof the following segments of the abdominal viscera is most likely to appear normal?
###Options:
A.  Ascending colon
B.  Distal ileum
C.  Distal jejunum
D.  Proximal ileum
E.  Proximal jejunum

###Answer:",E,"Given the patient's clinical presentation of acute severe abdominal pain and the findings of an embolus in the superior mesenteric artery, she likely has acute mesenteric ischemia. This condition results from inadequate blood flow to the small intestine, leading to ischemia and potential infarction of the affected bowel segments.In acute mesenteric ischemia, the segment of the bowel supplied by the affected artery (in this case, the superior mesenteric artery) becomes ischemic. The location of the embolus, just beyond the patent middle colic artery, suggests that the proximal portions of the small intestine (jejunum) may be affected, particularly the proximal jejunum.Therefore, during the laparotomy, the most likely segment of the abdominal viscera to appear normal is:(E) Proximal jejunum",Ascending colon,Distal ileum,Distal jejunum,Proximal ileum,Proximal jejunum,A,"A. Ascending colon Rationale:
The superior mesenteric artery supplies the majority of the small intestine, as well as the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon.

Four days later, he becomes lethargic and has fever with shaking chills. He refuses to bear weight on his left foot. Physical examination shows a warm, swollen, and extremely tender area around the puncture wound. What is the gram reaction of the likely causative agent?
###Options:
A.  Catalase-positive, gram-negative cocobacilli
B.  Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters
C.  Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters
D.  Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a soft tissue infection, likely cellulitis or abscess formation, around the puncture wound. The presence of fever with shaking chills, lethargy, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot are indicative of systemic involvement, suggesting a more severe infection.Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease, they are at an increased risk of infections due to impaired immune function and compromised blood flow to tissues, which can predispose them to complications such as osteomyelitis or septicemia.The characteristic warm, swollen, and extremely tender area around the wound suggests a bacterial infection, and the likely causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that commonly causes skin and soft tissue infections. The presence of coagulase, an enzyme that enables the bacterium to form clots, helps in its identification. Staphylococcus aureus typically appears as gram-positive cocci in clusters on Gram stain, hence the correct option is c) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters.This explanation aligns with the clinical presentation and common microbiological characteristics associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections.","Catalase-positive, gram-negative cocobacilli","Coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters","Oxidase-negative, gram-negative bacilli",none,D,"D.

###Answer:",D,"The nonspecific findings of anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria, vomiting, and unexplained fevers, along with specific laboratory abnormalities such as glucosuria without hyperglycemia, high urine pH despite mild or moderate serum hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and mild albuminuria in the presence of normal serum protein and albumin levels, suggest Fanconi syndrome (FS), also known as global proximal tubular dysfunction. FS can be either hereditary or acquired; hereditary forms are typically secondary to genetic abnormalities such as cystinosis, galactosemia, Wilson disease, and some mitochondrial disorders. Various agents can also cause FS, including certain medications like gentamicin, outdated tetracycline, cephalothin, cidofovir, valproic acid, streptozocin, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cisplatin, ifosfamide, as well as exposure to heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, cadmium, uranium, platinum), paraquat, maleic acid, and inhalation of glue (toluene). These agents exert their effects through mechanisms such as acute tubular necrosis, alteration of renal blood flow, intratubular obstruction, or allergic reactions within the kidney. Many of these toxic effects can be reduced or eliminated by discontinuing the offending agent.Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1, known as distal RTA, and type 4 both exhibit a positive urine anion gap, unlike type 3, which is not a recognized subtype of RTA. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a rare variant of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by early infancy-onset edema and hypoalbuminemia.",Renal tubular acidosis type 1,Renal tubular acidosis type 4,Renal tubular acidosis type 3,Hereditary Fanconi syndrome,Congenital nephrotic syndrome,D,"D. Hereditary Fanconi syndrome Rationale: Hereditary Fanconi syndrome is a proximal tubule disorder characterized by generalized reabsorption defects leading to urinary loss of glucose, protein, phosphorus, calcium, and other electrolytes. This results in metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and high urine pH and specific gravity. The other options are incorrect because:  Type 1 renal tubular acidosis presents with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a positive urine anion gap.
 Type 4 renal tubular acidosis presents with hyperkalemia.
 Type 3 renal tubular acidosis is extremely rare and presents with a mixed picture of type 1 and type 2 renal tubular acidosis.
 Congenital nephrotic syndrome presents with massive proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia but not with the other laboratory abnormalities seen in this case.",True,model2

###Options:
A.  Stimulant laxative
B.  Rectal manometry and barium enema
C.  Plain radiographs of the abdomen
D.  Observation
E.  None

###Answer:",B,"The child may have Hirschsprung disease, given the lifelong history of constipation and dependence on stool softeners.

Only 3% of patients have fecal soiling.

Rectal manometry and barium enema will aid in the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis is made by punch or suction biopsy.

Plain radiographs of the abdomen Rationale: The child's history is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. The initial presentation often involves delayed passage of meconium. Chronic constipation that persists despite stool softeners is a red flag. Plain radiographs of the abdomen can show a dilated proximal colon and a narrowed distal colon, which is a classic finding in Hirschsprung disease. Rectal manometry and barium enema are confirmatory tests but are not the appropriate next step. Stimulant laxatives are not recommended in young children. Observation is not appropriate as the child has significant symptoms.",False,model2

He is seen by the doctor and noted to have facial oedema and a tender distended abdomen. His temperature is 39.1 and his blood pressure is 91/46 mmHg. There is also clinical evidence of poor peripheral perfusion. What is the diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
B.  Intussusception
C.  Sickle cell crisis
D.  Henoch Schönlein purpura
E.  Appendicitis

###Answer:",A,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitisThe presence of periorbital and facial oedema with normal blood pressure in this toddler indicates that he has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individuals health and quality of life:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid  an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/µL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult. Delay of diagnosis can delay antifungal treatment and lead to a higher mortality rate.",Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Intussusception,Sickle cell crisis,Henoch Schönlein purpura,Appendicitis,A,"A.

A.  Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
B.  Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
C.  Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)
D.  Luteinizing Hormone (LH)

###Answer:",C,"ADH is unique in that its release is primarily regulated by the hypothalamus, specifically the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. These nuclei produce ADH in response to changes in blood osmolality and blood volume. ADH is then stored and released by the posterior pituitary gland. However, the release of ADH is ultimately controlled by negative feedback mechanisms, where changes in blood osmolality or volume trigger either the release or inhibition of ADH production. Therefore, while the pituitary gland indirectly influences ADH release, it is not directly regulated by the anterior or posterior pituitary gland as the other hormones listed are.",Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH),Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH),Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH),Luteinizing Hormone (LH),,B,"B. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Rationale:
TSH is not directly regulated by the pituitary gland. Instead, it is regulated by the hypothalamus, which releases Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to release TSH, which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are high, they exert negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, inhibiting the release of TRH and TSH, respectively. Thus, TSH is indirectly influenced by the pituitary gland through negative feedback mechanisms.",False,model2

###Answer:",E,"Patients who take dual anti-platelet medication in the form of dipyridamole and aspirin toprevent thrombotic events do not need to stop these medications before dentalextractions. Theoretically they are at slightly greater risk of postoperative bleeding, butthis can usually be managed satisfactorily with local haemostatic measures such as packing the socket and suturing. The risk of stopping the medications is that a thromboticevent will occur, which is more serious than a small postoperative haemorrhage; hencethe risks of stopping medications outweigh the benefits.",Preoperative INR blood test,Ask the patient to stop taking both the aspirin and the dipyridamole for 72 hours before the procedure,Ask the patient to stop taking both the aspirin and the dipyridamole for 7 days before the procedure,Ask the patient to stop taking the dipyridamole for 72 hours before the procedure,Use local haemostatic measures after removing the tooth,E,"E. Use local haemostatic measures after removing the tooth Rationale: Patients taking antiplatelet medications like aspirin and dipyridamole are at an increased risk of bleeding during surgical procedures. However, it is generally not recommended to stop these medications before dental extractions. This is because the risk of thromboembolic events (e.g., heart attack, stroke) outweighs the risk of bleeding. Therefore, it is essential to use local haemostatic measures, such as packing the socket with gauze or using a haemostatic agent, to control bleeding after the extraction.",True,model2

The pain is on the lateral shoulder, does not radiate, and is worse with overhead activity. She has pain at night when trying to sleep on her side, and has tried taking over-the-counter ibuprofen intermittently for pain relief. She denies any history of trauma or injury. She states that her normal activities include gardening, yoga, pickleball, and walking. The patient is right-handed. On physical examination, her symptoms are reproduced with both empty and full can test, and there is no external rotation lag sign. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a <50% supraspinatus tear. Which of the following treatments is recommended?
###Options:
A.  Corticosteroid injection
B.  Physical therapy
C.  Surgical repair
D.  Ibuprofen 3 times a day for 1-2 months
E.  Diazepam

###Answer:",B,"With the chronicity of her likely rotator cuff injury/tear, she would fit best as a group 2 patient. This grouping is for patients who may have surgical indications, but physical therapy is of equal benefit in the short term.

It can take from 6-12 weeks to see results from therapy. The best predictor of failure is a patient who does not believe rehabilitation can be effective at improving their pain and function.

Corticosteroids have never been shown to be of benefit in the healing of a rotator cuff tear. There is some literature showing an initial weakening of the tendon in the short term (14 days). These injections can be most effective in short-term pain relief. Caution should be exercised to avoid injecting directly into the tendon.

The natural history of cuff disease is for the tear to progress, but this generally happens when the tear is larger than 50%. The progression of the tear happens slowly, thus allowing time to see if the patient responds to this treatment. Rotator cuff tears are prevalent. About 25% of patients over 60 and 50% of patients over 80 have asymptomatic rotator cuff tears.",Corticosteroid injection,Physical therapy,Surgical repair,Ibuprofen 3 times a day for 1-2 months,Diazepam,B,"B.

###Options:
A.  Foreign body
B.  Nasal polyps
C.  Frontal sinusitis
D.  Deviated septum

However, as the obstruction persists, symptoms may escalate, manifesting as increased pain and the appearance of a purulent, foul-smelling, bloody discharge. When unilateral nasal discharge is present alongside obstruction, it suggests the possibility of a nasal foreign body and warrants examination. While polyps could potentially cause unilateral nasal obstruction, they are uncommon in children of 18 months and might indicate a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis, though not impossible, is rare in black children. Frontal sinusitis typically doesn't result in unilateral symptoms, and sinusitis is uncommon in an 18-month-old child due to incomplete sinus development at that age.

###Options:
A.  Nephrotic syndrome
B.  Child abuse
C.  Water intoxication
D.  Diabetes mellitus
E.  Diabetes insipidus

###Answer:",E,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a hereditary disorder characterized by the kidneys' inability to respond to antidiuretic hormone, resulting in hypotonic urine production in large volumes. Most North American patients affected by this condition are descendants of Ulster Scots who arrived in Nova Scotia in 1761 on the ship Hopewell. The disorder primarily affects males through X-linked recessive inheritance, involving inactivating mutations of the vasopressin V2 receptor. However, autosomal dominant and recessive forms also exist. The disorder is thought to arise from primary unresponsiveness of the distal tubule and collecting duct to vasopressin. While present at birth, the diagnosis is often delayed until several months later when symptoms such as excessive thirst, frequent voiding of large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, and failure to thrive become evident. Therapy for this incurable disease primarily involves maintaining adequate fluid intake, dietary management, and the use of saluretic medications to promote sodium excretion in the kidneys.Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can result from various medications (such as lithium, methicillin, rifampin, and amphotericin) and may also be associated with conditions like hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, polycystic kidney disease, Sjögren syndrome, and sickle cell disease.Water intoxication would not manifest with episodes of dehydration. Diabetes mellitus rarely presents with a protracted course in such a young child and is typically more acute, often accompanied by vomiting. Child abuse is unlikely, especially with a noted family history. Nephrotic syndrome would typically present with additional signs such as edema and proteinuria.",Nephrotic syndrome,Child abuse,Water intoxication,Diabetes mellitus,Diabetes insipidus,E,"E.

The patient reports heavy alcohol consumption and that he often ""passes out"" following consumption. He reports numbness in the left leg on the dorsum and sides of the foot. He is unable to pick his foot from the ground. Motor examination revealed that the patient was unable to dorsiflex his left foot. The sensory exam revealed absent sensation over the entire dorsum, including the first webspace. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these deficits?
###Options:
A.  Common peroneal nerve compression
B.  Sciatic nerve compression
C.  Tibial nerve compression
D.  Superficial peroneal nerve compression
E.  saphenous nerve damage

###Answer:",A,"The common Fibular(peroneal) nerve divides into superficial and deep divisions at the fibular head. An intoxicated state for a prolonged time could have led to compression at this location. This will result in symptoms involving weakness in the muscles supplied by the deep division, i.e., the dorsiflexors, and the superficial division, i.e., the evertors. The sensory loss will involve both the dorsum and the first web space supplied by the superficial and deep divisions, respectively.

The deep fibular division supplies the anterior compartment of the lower extremity. These are the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus tertius  these muscles aid in performing dorsiflexion, which brings the foot up during heel strike.

E.  intravenous cyclosporine

###Answer:",B,"Oral corticosteroids are a mainstay of firstline treatment for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Starting doses of 40 mg PO daily of prednisone, with a slow taper, are often effective in  reducing colonic inflammation, although some patients are unable to wean steroids or maintain remission once achieved. The patient does not have dysplasia in any biopsy specimens, nor does he have signs of systemic toxicity, so a colectomy would be premature. Oral metronidazole is ineffective in ulcerative colitis. Cortisone enemas would be helpful if the patient had isolated left-sided disease, but it is doubtful that enema therapy would reach his hepatic flexure. Intravenous cyclosporine would be used in severe colitis as a last measure before colectomy but this patient is not yet sick enough to warrant such therapy.

Syncope is very uncommon in patients with SVT.

SVT is a narrow complex tachycardia that has a regular but rapid rhythm. The exception is irregular atrial fibrillation.

Most patients present with palpitation or are asymptomatic. The arrhythmic is triggered by a reentry mechanism. Other triggers include hyperthyroidism, drugs, caffeine, and alcohol.",There is always a wide QRS.,"Even at rest, the heart rate is more than 100 bpm.",It is a well-known cause of a syncopal attack.,It does not require any treatment.,,C,"C. It is a well-known cause of a syncopal attack. Rationale:
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an arrhythmia that originates above the ventricles. It is characterized by a rapid heart rate, typically over 100 bpm, even at rest. SVT can cause a syncopal attack (fainting) due to the rapid heart rate, which can reduce blood flow to the brain. The other options are incorrect: SVT does not always have a wide QRS, it may require treatment, and it is not true that the heart rate is always over 100 bpm at rest.",False,model2

On physical examination, coarse crackles are present in the lower lobe of the right lung. A chest x-ray demonstrates an irregular cavity with an air-fluid level in the lateral part of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe of the lung. An elevated white blood cell count is present on the laboratory panel. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the pulmonary finding?
###Options:
A.  Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection
B.  Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions
C.  Pulmonary fungal infection
D.  Pulmonary tuberculosis
E.  sarcoidosis

###Answer:",B,"Lung abscesses are more common in immunocompromised hosts (HIV-AIDS, post-transplantation, or those receiving prolonged immune suppressive therapy). Lung abscesses are also common in those patients with a high risk for aspiration, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Lung abscess is included in infections such as necrotizing pneumonia and lung gangrene, which is characterized by multiple abscesses.

Patients with alcohol use disorder are more prone to develop lung abscesses due to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Abscesses that occur after oropharyngeal aspiration are localized in posterior segments of the lungs, and there are no patterns for hematological dissemination of lung abscesses. Common sites for lung abscess are the apical segment of the lower lobe of the right and sometimes of the left lung, then the lateral part of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, and the middle lobe in case of vomiting and aspiration in the prone position. This is typically for patients with alcohol use disorder. Seventy-five percent of all lung abscesses are located in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe or the apical segment of the lower lobe of both lungs.

Depending on the patient's immune status, a lung abscess can be indolent or symptomatic. History should focus on finding patients at risk of aspiration (impaired cognition, loss of bulbar motor function, immobility), causes of immune incompetence, oral or rectal instrumentation, intravenous drug use, and recent upper respiratory illness. Patients could present with fevers, chills, weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, or a cough, which might be productive or non-productive, based on the closeness of the abscess to the airway.

In tuberculosis, mostly the upper lobes of the lungs are involved.",Hematogenic dissemination from another focus of infection,Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions,Pulmonary fungal infection,Pulmonary tuberculosis,sarcoidosis,B,"B. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions Rationale: The patient's history of alcohol use disorder, foul-smelling sputum, and chest X-ray findings of a cavity with an air-fluid level in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe are suggestive of a lung abscess caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Alcohol use disorder can impair the gag reflex and increase the risk of aspiration. The posterior segment of the right upper lobe is a common location for aspiration pneumonia and lung abscesses due to the anatomy of the airways. The other options are less likely:  Hematogenic dissemination typically presents with multiple lesions in both lungs.
 Pulmonary fungal infections usually occur in immunocompromised patients.
 Pulmonary tuberculosis typically presents with upper lobe infiltrates and cavitation.
 Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that can affect the lungs but is less likely to present with a solitary cavity.",True,model2

A physical examination demonstrates external hemorrhoids. The provider gives her verbal counseling as well as written recommendations for the initial treatment of her hemorrhoidal disease. Which of the following is not a recommended treatment?
###Options:
A.  High fiber diet
B.  Increased water intake
C.  Stimulant laxatives
D.  Warm sitz baths
E.  low fiber diet

###Answer:",C,"Conservative therapy is considered the first-line treatment for symptomatic hemorrhoids. This includes increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and increased water intake. These modifications can decrease straining and the sheering pressure associated with passing stool, which alleviates congestion and allows hemorrhoid cushions to return to their natural, nonpathological state.

Increased fiber intake can help with symptomatic hemorrhoids but must be accompanied by adequate water intake to ensure that stool is not just bulky, but also soft. Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that softens stool by increasing the water content of stool. Docusate is an anionic surfactant that promotes water and lipid entry into stool, thus softening it.

Stimulant laxatives should be avoided due to the risk of dependence.

Warm sitz baths can ease the pain associated with symptomatic hemorrhoids and can be useful for managing postoperative pain after a hemorrhoidectomy.",High fiber diet,Increased water intake,Stimulant laxatives,Warm sitz baths,low fiber diet,E,"E. low fiber diet Rationale:

mental status over the past several months. Her vision is normal. A CT scan reveals
hydrocephalus, but the lumbar puncture pressure is unexpectedly low. What does she
have?



###Options:
A.  Meningitis
B.  Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
C.  Sigmoid sinus thrombosis
D.  Echinococcus
E.  Glioblastoma multiforme

###Answer:",B,"The correct answer is B. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an increase in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain's ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus. However, unlike other forms of hydrocephalus, the pressure of CSF within the ventricles remains within the normal range.

The classic triad of symptoms in NPH includes gait disturbance (imbalance), cognitive impairment (deterioration of mental status), and urinary incontinence. Vision is typically not affected in NPH.

The unexpected finding of low lumbar puncture pressure in the context of hydrocephalus is consistent with NPH. In NPH, the pressure of CSF in the ventricles may be elevated, but the pressure in the lumbar subarachnoid space, where the lumbar puncture is performed, may be normal or low.

The other options listed are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings:

A. Meningitis: Meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and often, altered mental status. However, it is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

C. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis: Sigmoid sinus thrombosis typically presents with headache, ear pain, and sometimes, focal neurological deficits. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

D. Echinococcus: Echinococcus infection (hydatid disease) typically presents with cystic lesions in various organs, depending on where the larvae settle. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

E. Glioblastoma multiforme: Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain tumor that typically presents with focal neurological deficits, seizures, and sometimes, raised intracranial pressure. It is less likely to present with hydrocephalus and low lumbar puncture pressure.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and findings described, the most likely diagnosis is Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (option B).

Investigation is not required if the baby is breast fed and otherwise well Rationale:
Breast milk jaundice is a common and usually harmless condition in breastfed babies. It is caused by a substance in breast milk that can interfere with the breakdown of bilirubin. In most cases, no investigation is required if the baby is otherwise well and the jaundice appears after the first few days of life. The other options are incorrect:
- High conjugated bilirubin is not typical of breast milk jaundice.
- The baby's faeces should be yellow or brown in breast milk jaundice.
- Formula milk is not recommended for breast milk jaundice.
- Jaundice in breast milk jaundice typically resolves within 2-3 weeks of age.",False,model2

###Answer:",C,"TSH is used to adjust the dosage because TSH secretion is sensitive to feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones. Particularly in primary hypothyroidism, TSH is the first laboratory test to be ordered.

As the levels of thyroid hormones normalize, it will improve the levels of TSH to the normal range and increase the free T4 levels to the target range.

Free T4 is helpful in secondary hypothyroidism; however, in primary hypothyroidism, it does add additional information. However, TSH is the best test to titrate the levothyroxine dose.

###Answer:",E,"Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that is effective against drugs with high emetogenic activity, such as cisplatin. Although dolasetron is also in this category, its propensity to affect the heart makes it a poor choice for this patient. Droperidol also affects the heart and now is generally a second-line drug used in combination with opioids or benzodiazepines.

###Answer:",B,"Urologic injuries, such as to the bladder or ureters, are rare complications of the cesarean section.

Many physicians may choose cesarean section techniques based on tradition rather than evidence.

In several trials, the omission of a bladder flap decreased operative time and did not increase complications such as hematuria, pain, or urinary tract infection. However, bladder injury is rare, and studies have been underpowered to detect whether the omission of the bladder flap changes the incidence of bladder injury.

C.  Intravenous lines
D.  Hematogenous spread via the mother's blood
E.  none of the above

###Answer:",B,"This infant developed fever and lethargy, indicating neonatal sepsis. The gram stain demonstrates the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the likely diagnosis of ophthalmia neonatorum and disseminated gonococcal infection.

The patient also complains of tiredness and feeling short of breath after climbing a few steps. Physical examination shows increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, and pedal edema. The provider prescribed a medication that is known to increase intracellular calcium levels and has a positive ionotropic effect on the heart. What is the mechanism of action of the drug prescribed by the provider?
###Options:
A.  Decreasing conduction at the sino-atrial node
B.  Blocking calcium channels
C.  Blocking beta receptors
D.  Inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase (Sodium-Potassium ATPase) pump
E.  Blocking alpha receptors

###Answer:",D,"Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K ATPase) pump, which is an enzyme that is needed for the active transport of sodium outside and potassium inside the myocardial cell membrane. This creates a transmembranous gradient, which is used by Na-Ca (sodium-calcium) antiporter. Inhibiting Na-K ATPase leads to increased intracellular sodium; this, in turn, decreases the function of the sodium antiporter that brings sodium ions inside the cell and exports calcium outside the cell. Decreased transmembrane gradient decreases the activity of the Na-Ca antiporter, thus increasing intracellular Ca, which also leads to Ca-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Increased intracellular calcium results in an increased force of contraction. Intracellular calcium leads to the prolongation of phases 4 and 0 of the cardiac action potential. It also acts on the atrioventricular node by increasing the parasympathetic tone mediated by the vagus nerve, therefore decreasing the heart rate.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of digoxin include increased PR interval, decreased QT interval, and inversion of the T wave.

C.  Abdominal ultrasound
D.  Plain radiograph of the abdomen
E.  CT scan

###Answer:",C,"The patient, being between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, most likely has ileocolic intussusception.

The history is consistent with this diagnosis, and occasionally a sausage-shaped mass can be palpated in the right upper quadrant. Plain radiographs may be helpful to exclude perforation or when ultrasound is not immediately available and can show characteristic bowel obstruction. The ""target sign,"" consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on the right kidney, represents peritoneal fat surrounding and within the intussusception. The ""crescent sign"" is a soft tissue density representing the intussusceptum projecting into the gas of the large bowel, obscured liver margin, or lack of air in the cecum.

Air, saline, or barium enema can reduce the intussusception or make the diagnosis but are not usually the first study ordered because there is a risk of bowel rupture. Prior to the enema, the patient must be cleared for surgery. There is no preparation required for an abdominal ultrasound.

If recurrent late decelerations with no variability (category 3) persist or are not promptly evaluated and treated, this can lead to increased fetal morbidity and mortality. So, the immediate step is to assess and examine the station of the fetal head if operative vaginal delivery is an option.

Immediate operative vaginal delivery is not appropriate before assessing the station of the fetal head if operative vaginal delivery is an option.

Recurrent late decelerations can be precarious as they can become hazardous if not promptly evaluated. Evaluating the entire fetal heart tracing and maternal status is essential. Consideration is necessary to the degree of variability and presence or absence of accelerations, and the underlying cause of the deceleration must be addressed immediately.

Her physical examination reveals a hard, immobile 5 x 2 cm mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. On ultrasound, the mass is hypoechoic with irregular borders and septations. An excisional biopsy is performed and the sample is ER+. The patient undergoes bilateral radical mastectomies. Which of the following is the most appropriate adjuvant therapy?
###Options:
A.  Finasteride
B.  Fadrozole
C.  Clomiphene citrate
D.  Letrozole
E.  progesterone

###Answer:",D,"Adjuvant chemotherapy prevents breast cancer recurrence and is indicated in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptive breast cancer with a mass of >1 cm at diagnosis or evidence of metastasis. An increase in cells that express ER is present in a majority of breast cancers. Therefore, a variety of pharmacologic agents have been developed to decrease estrogen production and activity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (like tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (like anastrozole) are approved for use in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer because of their mechanisms related to decreasing estrogen levels.

Letrozole and anastrozole are both third-generation aromatase inhibitors that are the most specific toward targeting aromatase and are the most appropriate drugs of choice when choosing aromatase Inhibitors.

Fadrozole is a second-generation aromatase inhibitor that exhibited less specificity for the enzyme aromatase and has an increase of adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, rashes, etc. in comparison to third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Clomiphene citrate is a drug that induces ovulation in patients with infertility or PCOS.",Finasteride,Fadrozole,Clomiphene citrate,Letrozole,progesterone,D,"D. Letrozole Rationale:
The patient has breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive (ER+). Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens, reducing estrogen levels in the body.

He has had multiple episodes of watery, tea-colored loose stools for the past eight months. He often has to get up in the middle of the night and states that fasting does not improve his symptoms. There is no history of blood in stools. However, he has lost about 16 pounds (7.3 kg) in weight during the same period. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, for which he uses subcutaneous insulin. He also has a history of cholecystectomy ten years back, for symptomatic cholelithiasis. His examination reveals a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 12 per minute, and a temperature of 98 F. His systemic examination is unremarkable. His investigations reveal a WBC count of 6,000 per microL, a hemoglobin of 11gm/dl, a platelet count 250,000 per microL, serum ALT 35 IU/L, serum AST 30 IU/L, serum creatinine 0.8 mg /dl, serum sodium 135 meq/l , serum potassium 2.8 meq/l , serum chloride 110 meq/l, serum bicarbonate 18 meq/l, arterial pH 7.2, HbA1c 7.1% , blood sugar random 150 mg/dl and serum CRP 3.5 mg/l. His stool examination is negative for ova and cysts, and stool culture is negative. The stool osmolar gap is calculated to be 40 mOsm/kg. A colonoscopy with biopsy is normal. A contrast-enhanced CT scan reveals the presence of a 3 cm solitary mass in the tail of the pancreas. Urinary 5 hydroxytryptamine level is normal. The patient is treated with fluid and electrolyte supplementation. Which of the following is an appropriate treatment option in this patient?
###Options:
A.  Rifaxamine
B.  Clonidine
C.  Octreotide
D.  Cholestyramine
E.  Lomotil

###Answer:",C,"This patient has presented with chronic, voluminous diarrhea which does not resolve on fasting. The laboratory findings of hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, and normal anion gap acidosis along with normal stool osmolar gap make the diagnosis of secretory diarrhea. The presence of a solitary pancreatic lesion indicates the presence of pancreatic VIPoma. Somatostatin analogs are useful for the management of VIPoma.

VIPomas are functional neuroendocrine tumors that secrete vasoactive intestinal peptide. The signs and symptoms are due to hormonal activation. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide and lanreotide are highly effective in controlling diarrhea in VIPoma.

The initial dose of octreotide is 50-100 mcg subcutaneously every 8 hours, followed by titration as required. Monthy depot intramuscular formulations are available once symptom control is adequate.

Octreotide is usually well tolerated but can have some important side effects such as gall bladder hypomotility. Treatment with glucocorticoids can be considered in individuals with resistant diarrhea. Clonidine is useful in diarrhea associated with diabetic autonomic enteropathy, which is unlikely given the good glycemic control. Diarrhea can be present post-cholecystectomy due to malabsorption of bile salts; it is mainly osmotic and responds to cholestyramine. Small bowel overgrowth can be managed with oral antibiotics such as rifaxamine.",Rifaxamine,Clonidine,Octreotide,Cholestyramine,Lomotil,C,"C. Octreotide Rationale: The patient presents with persistent watery diarrhea, weight loss, and a solitary mass in the tail of the pancreas. The stool osmolar gap is low, indicating a secretory diarrhea. The absence of ova, cysts, and pathogens in the stool and a normal colonoscopy rule out infectious and structural causes of diarrhea. The presence of a pancreatic mass suggests a pancreatic endocrine tumor. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that inhibits the secretion of several hormones, including those that cause secretory diarrhea, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Therefore, octreotide is an appropriate treatment option for secretory diarrhea caused by a pancreatic endocrine tumor, as in this patient.",True,model2

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg. On examination, she is noted to have some digital nail pitting and bilateral papilledema. No abdominal bruit is present. Laboratory values are significant for thrombocytopenia, normocytic anemia, increased indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, elevated LDH, BUN 23 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3 mg/dl, and glucose 112 mg/dl. Urine analysis shows mild proteinuria. The patient has no known kidney disease, no history of hypertension and laboratory values from 6 months ago were all within normal limits. On further questioning her medical history, she states that she had some recent onset of heartburn for which she has been taking omeprazole. Which of the following is the most likely cause for her sudden increase in blood pressure?
###Options:
A.  Pheochromocytoma
B.  Scleroderma
C.  Lupus flare
D.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome
E.  urticaria

###Answer:",B,"Given the patient's young age and acute change in her blood pressure, a secondary cause of hypertension has to be considered. The presence of the Raynaud phenomenon, nail pitting on the exam, and heartburn (which may be suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease) are clues that the patient may have underlying systemic sclerosis.

Systemic sclerosis is characterized by abnormal deposition of collagenous material in multiple organ systems. Collagenous deposition can cause thickening of the wall of blood vessels, which in turn causes narrowing of the vascular lumen and the renal arterioles, resulting in hypertension and ischemia, leading to scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). SRC develops in about 5 to 20% of systemic sclerosis patients and is characterized by a sudden onset of hypertension (blood pressure greater than 150/85 mmHg) and a progressive decline in renal function. It may also be characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy, acute retinal changes of malignant hypertension, and new-onset proteinuria or hematuria, as seen in this case. Also, this patient is on chronic steroids, which is an added risk factor for the development of SRC. Other risk factors for SRC include the presence of autoantibodies against RNA polymerase, early-stage disease with diffuse skin involvement, palpable tendon friction rubs on examination, and cyclosporine use.

To confirm the diagnosis, serological tests can be used: autoantibodies against RNA polymerase III or a fine-speckled immunofluorescence pattern on ANA testing. SRC is managed with ACE inhibitors (viz: captopril).

Pheochromocytoma is characterized by episodic tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, and headache. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is primarily seen in children. Sudden onset renal failure is present but usually has a preceding history of diarrhea and has predominant hematological symptoms like thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also, this patient has other clinical features suggestive of scleroderma (e.g., nail pitting, GERD, Raynaud phenomenon). A lupus flare is unlikely, given that the patient is on chronic long-term steroids and has no other features of a lupus flare.",Pheochromocytoma,Scleroderma,Lupus flare,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,urticaria,B,"B. Scleroderma Rationale: The patient's presentation is consistent with scleroderma renal crisis, which is a severe complication of scleroderma. The symptoms include sudden onset of hypertension, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by normocytic anemia, increased indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and elevated LDH), and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine).

Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of the feedback control system that most likely caused this patient's syncopal episode?
###Options:
A.  Baroreceptor hypersensitivity
B.  Chemoreceptor hypersensitivity
C.  Impaired parasympathetic response
D.  Impaired glossopharyngeal nerve signaling
E.  None

###Answer:",A,"This patient, who had a syncopal episode while shaving, likely has carotid sinus hypersensitivity. The pressure on his carotid sinus from the razor while shaving caused transient hypotension, bradycardia, or both.

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is hypothesized to be caused by overly sensitive sensors (carotid baroreceptors), overly responsive controllers (glossopharyngeal nerve, medulla), or effectors (parasympathetic nervous system).

Homeostasis is a regulatory system conceptualized by 5 critical components in a reflex loop: the sensor, setpoint, error detector, controller, and effector.

Various control systems are in place within the body to detect change caused by disruptors and employ effectors to mediate the change to mitigate disruption. Over-activity and under-activity of any control system may potentially be clinically problematic for a patient.",Baroreceptor hypersensitivity,Chemoreceptor hypersensitivity,Impaired parasympathetic response,Impaired glossopharyngeal nerve signaling,,A,"A. Baroreceptor hypersensitivity Rationale:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is caused by an exaggerated response of the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus. When pressure is applied to the carotid sinus (as in shaving under the chin), the baroreceptors sense an increase in blood pressure and trigger a reflex decrease in heart rate and blood pressure through the parasympathetic nervous system. This can lead to a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain, causing syncope.",True,model2

###Options:
A.  Pulmonary embolism
B.  Hypervolemia
C.  Right heart failure
D.  Gram-negative sepsis
E.  Hypovolemia

###Answer:",D,"Determination of CVP has been helpful in the overall hemodynamic assessment of the patient. This pressure can be affected by a variety of factors including those of cardiac, noncardiac, and artifactual origin.

Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia increase CVP.

Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure.

Sepsis, on the other hand, decreases CVP through both the release of vasodilatory mediators and the loss of intravascular plasma volume due to increased capillary permeability. Trends in CVP measurement are more reliable than isolated readings.",Pulmonary embolism,Hypervolemia,Right heart failure,Gram-negative sepsis,Hypovolemia,E,"E. Hypovolemia Rationale: The patient's low blood pressure, low urine output, and low CVP are all signs of hypovolemia.

###Options:
A.  Erythematous tonsils
B.  cough
C.  Tonsilar exudates
D.  Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
E.  halitosis

###Answer:",C,"Pharyngitis is a commonly encountered problem in primary care. Patients with upper respiratory symptoms are often convinced that they need antibiotics. Often the etiology is viral, but ruling out bacterial etiology is crucial as the secondary complications can be severe. In terms of group A strep pharyngitis, it is often difficult to make a clinical diagnosis based on one or two factors. Many studies have been performed to guide the clinician in making an empiric diagnosis of group A strep pharyngitis. Fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough and tonsillar hypertrophy are all positive predictors. A patient who has at least two of these criteria should have a rapid strep test or culturewith treatment initiated if the test is positive. When a patient meets three or more criteria and is ill appearing, empiric treatment may be justified. If the patient has a negative rapid strep test and the clinician is suspicious, empiric treatment may be started and throat culture should be obtained. Apatient with a positive culture or rapid strep test should be treated, but a test of cure does not need to be performed. The throat culture has a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99%, while the rapid strep test has a sensitivity of 8097% and a specificity of >95%. (Am Fam Physician 2004;69(6): 14651470) The first-line medication for patients diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin.

The patient was instructed to discontinue warfarin prior to a unilateral total knee arthroplasty 2 weeks ago. The patient was discharged on the same day of the surgery. He resumed his warfarin 3 days after surgery. His postoperative recovery has been uneventful so far. He began physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening 2 days ago.

###Options:
A.  Spinal stenosis
B.  Claudication
C.  Dissecting aortic aneurysm
D.  Deep venous thrombosis
E.  none

###Answer:",A,"Spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by pain in the legs, calves, thighs, and buttocks that occurs with walking, running, or climbing stairs. Symptoms are often relieved by flexing the spine or sitting. Conversely, lying prone or in any position that extends the lumbar spine exacerbates the symptoms, presumably because of ventral infolding of the ligamentum flavum in a canal already significantly narrowed by degenerative osseous changes.

Middle-aged and older patients are most commonly affected. Typically, the earliest complaint is back pain, which is relatively nonspecific and may result in delayed diagnosis.

Spinal stenosis may be difficult to distinguish from claudication; however, spinal stenosis usually has neurologic deficits, and peripheral pulses are normal.

MRI scanning, with its multiplanar-imaging capability, is currently the preferred modality for establishing a diagnosis and excluding other conditions. Loss of epidural fat on T1-weighted images, loss of cerebrospinal fluid signal around the dural sac on T2-weighted images, and degenerative disc disease are common features of lumbar stenosis on MRI. Treatment for symptomatic lumbar stenosis is usually surgical decompression.",Spinal stenosis,Claudication,Dissecting aortic aneurysm,Deep venous thrombosis,none,B,"B. Claudication Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of pain in both lower legs that is exacerbated with walking and relieved with sitting are classic for claudication. This is caused by inadequate blood flow to the muscles of the legs during exercise. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent surgery put him at increased risk for thrombosis, which could lead to claudication.

She reports having double vision which was intermittent initially but has now become much more frequent. In addition, she becomes breathless very easily and experiences palpitations. On examination, raised, painless lesions are observed on the front of her shins and finger clubbing. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  De Quervains thyroiditis
B.  Thyroid storm
C.  Phaeochromocytoma
D.  Graves disease
E.  Plummers disease

###Answer:",D,"Graves disease (D) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The condition is due to IgG antibodies binding to the TSH receptor, this in turn causes excess production of thyroid hormone. The antibodies also bind to other areas of the body such as the extraocular muscles leading to gaze abnormalities, the shins causing raised lesions known as pretibial myxoedema and rarely the fingers causing clubbing known as thyroid acropachy. These collective signs are only seen in Graves disease, hence it is the only correct answer. De Quervains thyroiditis (A) is a transient thyroid state most likely due to a viral infection. The patient usually complains of a fever and painful neck with some signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, as well as raised ESR levels. A few weeks later, the patient suffers from transient hypothyroid symptoms before returning to a euthyroid state. Phaeochromocytomas (C) are malignancies of the sympathetic nervous system, 90 per cent arise in the adrenal medulla and produce excess catecholamines. The symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma are often similar to hyperthyroidism and include anxiety, palpitations and headache. However, these symptoms are usually intermittent and the main risk to patients is from cardiovascular compromise. Plummers disease (E) is a solitary nodule in the thyroid gland producing excess thyroid hormones. It is usually refractory to antithyroid treatment. A thyroid storm or crisis (B) is a rapid deterioration in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism, often stimulated by a stressor such as infection. Patients present with acute-onset, severe tachycardia, distress and hyperpyrexia.",De Quervains thyroiditis,Thyroid storm,Phaeochromocytoma,Graves disease,Plummers disease,D,"D. Graves disease Rationale:
The symptoms described are characteristic of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism.

She is a multiparous woman with regular menstrual cycles, and her last menstrual period was 13 days ago. Her medical problems include hypertension which is well controlled on medication. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily and denies using alcohol or illicit drugs. She is scared of needles and does not want any device placed in her body. She is not planning to have more children at this time and would like to get on reliable contraception after the current incident with the condom. On exam, her vitals are  temperature 37 °C (98.6 °F), heart rate 70 bpm, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft, and the speculum exam reveals the retained condom. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
###Options:
A.  Remove the condom and start on antibiotics to prevent pelvic infection
B.  Remove the visualized condom and refer to her primary care provider for initiating contraception in 1 week
C.  Remove the condom, give her levonorgestrel for postcoital contraception, and prescribe regular contraception with a progesterone-only pill
D.  Remove the condom, give her levonorgestrel for postcoital contraception, and prescribe regular contraception with combined oral contraceptive pills for reliable contraception
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"Prompt removal of the foreign body and initiating postcoital contraception should be the next step in managing this patient.

When a levonorgestrel regimen consisting of combined oral contraceptive pills is used as emergency contraception, the patient can be started with any hormonal methods for regular contraception with the quick-start method.

When ulipristal acetate is used, due to concern about the antiprogestin effect, it is recommended that oral hormonal contraceptives are started during the next cycle. IUD is another option, but not acceptable for this patient.

A retained foreign body should be removed immediately when visualized. When there is no clinical evidence of infection in a patient with a monogamous relationship, antibiotics are generally not required to prevent infection. However, if high-risk sexual behavior is suspected, it would be appropriate to screen for sexually transmitted infections. It is essential to start on emergency postcoital contraception if there are condom accidents in midcycle to avoid conception. Sperm can survive in the female genital tract for up to 5 days, and women can conceive if ovulation occurs around that time. Postcoital contraceptives are effective when started earlier and should be offered as soon as possible. Waiting to see another clinician would delay treatment and is not appropriate. This patient has controlled hypertension and is a current smoker. The progestin-only method is preferable over combined oral contraceptive (COC) pills in current smokers. COC is USMEC (US medical eligibility criteria for contraception) 3, meaning the benefit outweighs the risk in current smokers.",Remove the condom and start on antibiotics to prevent pelvic infection,Remove the visualized condom and refer to her primary care provider for initiating contraception in 1 week,"Remove the condom, give her levonorgestrel for postcoital contraception, and prescribe regular contraception with a progesterone-only pill","Remove the condom, give her levonorgestrel for postcoital contraception, and prescribe regular contraception with combined oral contraceptive pills for reliable contraception",none,C,"C. Remove the condom, give her levonorgestrel for postcoital contraception, and prescribe regular contraception with a progesterone-only pill Rationale: The next best step is to remove the condom to prevent complications such as infection or irritation. Levonorgestrel is a progestin-only emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. As the patient does not want any device placed in her body and is not planning to have more children, a progesterone-only pill is a suitable option for regular contraception. This type of contraception is safe for women with hypertension and does not contain estrogen, which can increase the risk of blood clots in smokers.",True,model2

On physical examination, he looks slightly depressed, his responses are slow, and deep tendon reflexes are delayed. What is the most appropriate step in management?
###Options:
A.  Stop carbamazepine and start phenytoin.
B.  Measure thyroid stimulating hormone level.
C.  Measure parathyroid hormone level.
D.  Check carbamazepine level.
E.  MRI brain to look for the extension of the dise

###Answer:",B,"The mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement. The drug of choice is titrated levothyroxine sodium administered orally. It should not be given with iron or calcium supplements, aluminum hydroxide, and proton pump inhibitors to avoid suboptimal absorption. It is best taken early in the morning on an empty stomach for optimum absorption.

The standard dose is 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg per day, but it can vary from one patient to another. Patients < 50 years old should be started on a standard full dose; however, lower doses should be used in patients with cardiovascular diseases and the older population.

In patients > 50 years, the recommended starting dose is 25 mcg/day with reevaluation in 6 to 8 weeks. In pregnancy, the dose of thyroxine needs to be increased by 30%, and in patients with short-bowel syndrome, increased doses of levothyroxine are needed to maintain a euthyroid state.

###Options:
A.  Elliptocytosis.
B.  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
C.  Pyruvate kinase deficiency.
D.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura.
E.  Sickle cell anemia

###Answer:",D,"Hemolytic anemias are categorized as either intracorpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular disorders, the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) have a shortened lifespan due to an intrinsic factor within the RBC itself. Conversely, extracorpuscular disorders result in a shortened RBC lifespan due to factors external to the RBC.Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acquired disorder characterized by microangiopathy-induced destruction of RBCs and platelets due to destructive shear forces. Symptoms may include fever, mental status changes, and renal impairment. Most acquired adult cases of TTP involve autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS-13. Evaluation for schistocytes in a peripheral smear is crucial for ruling out TTP, as plasmapheresis is lifesaving.Other causes of extravascular hemolytic anemia encompass hypersplenism, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.The remaining disorders listed entail defects within the RBC itself leading to hemolysis:- Elliptocytosis: a membranopathy resulting in varying degrees of RBC destruction within the reticuloendothelial system.- Sickle cell anemia: a congenital hemoglobinopathy characterized by recurrent pain crises and long-term sequelae, stemming from a well-defined ²-globin mutation.- Pyruvate kinase deficiency: a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway causing hemolytic anemia.- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): an acquired hemolysis due to an intrinsic abnormality of RBCs, often accompanied by thrombosis and cytopenias, with bone marrow failure as a serious complication.",Elliptocytosis.,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,Pyruvate kinase deficiency.,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura.,Sickle cell anemia,D,"D. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura Rationale: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia, meaning that the red blood cell destruction occurs outside of the cell.

###Options:
A.  Zona fasciculata
B.  Zona reticularis
C.  Medulla
D.  Zona glomerulosa
E.  Fasciculata

###Answer:",C,"The adrenal gland, also called the suprarenal gland, is a significant part of the endocrine system. It is composed of 2 distinct tissues: the outer layer or cortex and the inner layer or medulla. The adrenal cortex is composed of 3 distinct zones: zona glomerulosa (outer layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer), and zona reticularis (inner zone).

The adrenal medulla is made up of specialized cells known as chromaffin cells, which aggregate in small clusters around blood vessels. The chromaffin cells in the medulla synthesize epinephrine and norepinephrine. These sympathetic hormones have many physiological activities, including playing a role in the ""fight or flight"" response, increasing heart rate, the force of contraction of the heart, metabolic rate, and cognitive awareness.

Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that arises from chromaffin cells present in the adrenal medulla. It can present with vague symptoms like a headache (50%), palpitations (60%), and diaphoresis (50%) that can lead to a paroxysmal hypertensive crisis due to increased catecholamine production.

His past medical history is significant for a celiac disease diagnosed at age 24. He has no other significant past medical history. He also complains of numbness and tingling in his feet bilaterally. His physician orders a complete blood count (CBC), which reveals a decrease in hemoglobin of 7.5 mg/dL and hematocrit of 22%. The patient is suspected of a vitamin deficiency, which is confirmed by a peripheral blood smear that shows hypersegmented neutrophils, with a portion of the neutrophils having greater than or equal to 5 lobes. What type of anemia does this patient most likely have?
###Options:
A.  Macrocytic and hyperchromic
B.  Macrocytic and microchromic
C.  Macrocytic and normochromic
D.  Normocytic and macrochromic
E.  none

###Answer:",C,"This patient likely has a vitamin B12 deficiency due to chronic inflammation in the terminal ileum due to his history of celiac disease.

Vitamin B12 binds to a glycoprotein known as intrinsic factor, which is produced by parietal cells in the stomach. The complex is subsequently absorbed in the terminal ileum.

Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for the synthesis of myelin and can lead to a condition known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord when deficient. As a result, patients may present with neurological findings, such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.

Vitamin B12 plays an essential role in the synthesis of DNA, and deficiency can lead to macrocytic anemia. A complete blood count (CBC) would reveal a decrease in hemoglobin, a decrease in hematocrit, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A peripheral blood smear would show large red blood cells with hypersegmented neutrophils. The anemia is macrocytic and normochromic unless there is also iron deficiency.",Macrocytic and hyperchromic,Macrocytic and microchromic,Macrocytic and normochromic,Normocytic and macrochromic,none,C,"C. Macrocytic and normochromic Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, skin discoloration, and numbness and tingling in the feet are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The peripheral blood smear findings of hypersegmented neutrophils with greater than or equal to 5 lobes are also characteristic of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a macrocytic (large red blood cells) and normochromic (normal red blood cell color) anemia. This is because vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis, and its deficiency leads to impaired cell division and the production of large, immature red blood cells.",True,model2

The patient describes the pain as dull, 6/10 in intensity, and occurring a few hours after a meal. His medical history includes alcohol use disorder and a 10-pack-year smoking history. A trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alleviates the patient's pain. What change in pepsin levels in the stomach will occur 2 weeks later?
###Options:
A.  Pepsin increases due to increased H ions within the stomach.
B.  Pepsin increases due to increased pH within the stomach.
C.  Pepsin decreases due to increased pH within the stomach.
D.  Pepsin decreases due to increased H ions within the stomach.
E.  alkalosis

###Answer:",C,"Pepsin is a stomach enzyme that serves to digest proteins found in ingested food.

Pepsinogen, secreted by the chief cells of the gastric mucosa, becomes activated and forms pepsin by the addition of hydrogen ions.

Hydrogen ions are secreted into the gastric juice by proton pumps in the parietal cells.

Proton pump inhibitors are acid-suppressing agents that work by directly inhibiting acid release. Examples of PPIs include omeprazole and esomeprazole. Following PPI administration, hydrogen ion secretion is expected to decrease, leading to increased pH. High pH levels in the stomach decrease pepsinogen activation, and pepsin levels decline.",Pepsin increases due to increased H ions within the stomach.,Pepsin increases due to increased pH within the stomach.,Pepsin decreases due to increased pH within the stomach.,Pepsin decreases due to increased H ions within the stomach.,alkalosis,C,"C. Pepsin decreases due to increased pH within the stomach. Rationale: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) block the production of stomach acid (H+ ions), leading to an increase in stomach pH. Pepsin is an enzyme that functions optimally in an acidic environment. When the pH of the stomach increases, the activity of pepsin decreases. Therefore, the use of PPIs would lead to a decrease in pepsin levels due to the increased pH within the stomach.",True,model2

When sodium bicarbonate reacts with gastric acid, it produces carbon dioxide, which can also contribute to alkalosis. The other antacids listed do not pose as high a risk of metabolic alkalosis because they are not absorbed systemically to the same extent.",True,model2

###Options:
A.  Serum methylmalonate
B.  Red blood cell folate
C.  Serum cobalamin
D.  Serum pepsinogen
E.  Serum homocysteine

###Answer:",C,"Serum cobalamin levels, typically measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serve as a cost-effective means to rule out deficiency, with normal levels above 200 ng/L. In cases of megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency, levels usually fall below 100 ng/L, correlating with the severity of deficiency. Notably, even in the absence of anemia, individuals with spinal cord damage from cobalamin deficiency exhibit very low serum levels. Borderline low levels may be observed in pregnancy with megaloblastic anemia stemming from folate deficiency. Elevated serum methylmalonate (MMA) levels indicate cobalamin deficiency-induced anemia or neuropathy, while elevated homocysteine levels suggest early cobalamin or folate deficiency, though they may also occur in various other conditions. Red blood cell folate assays offer insights into body folate stores, less influenced by recent diet or hemolysis compared to serum assays. Subnormal levels may indicate folate deficiency anemia or severe cobalamin deficiency. False-normal results can arise post-blood transfusion or with increased reticulocyte count. Low serum pepsinogen levels may indicate pernicious anemia.",Serum methylmalonate,Red blood cell folate,Serum cobalamin,Serum pepsinogen,Serum homocysteine,C,"C. Serum cobalamin Rationale: Serum cobalamin is the most cost-effective test for assessing cobalamin deficiency. It directly measures the level of vitamin B12 in the blood. While other tests, such as serum methylmalonate and homocysteine, can also indicate cobalamin deficiency, they are more expensive and may not be as readily available. Red blood cell folate assesses folate deficiency, and serum pepsinogen is used to diagnose pernicious anemia, a specific cause of cobalamin deficiency.",True,model2

She is anxious about the probability of Rh hemolytic disease in her newborn after reading about it on the Internet. She has no history of prior hospital admissions or blood transfusions. The patient's blood type is A positive, and her husband is O negative. Ultrasound reveals an intrauterine pregnancy measuring approximately 30 weeks of gestation with good fetal cardiac activity and no obvious anomalies. What is the most appropriate next step in the care of the patient?
###Options:
A.  Reassure the patient that Rh hemolytic disease is extremely unlikely.
B.  Order antenatal fetal surveillance due to the risk of ABO incompatibility.
C.  Perform the Rosette test for antibody detection in maternal serum.
D.  Give the patient Rho(D) immune globulin.
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",A,"Rh incompatibility develops when an Rh-negative female individual conceives an Rh-positive fetus. Therefore, this Rh-positive patient should not develop Rh hemolytic disease, and reassurance is appropriate.

If the mother is Rh positive, the probability of developing Rh-hemolytic disease would be minimal, especially in the first pregnancy.

ABO incompatibility develops when a woman with blood group O conceives a fetus with an A or B blood group. Therefore, this patient with A-positive blood should not develop an ABO compatibility because her partner has O-negative blood.

This patient is Rh positive.",Reassure the patient that Rh hemolytic disease is extremely unlikely.,Order antenatal fetal surveillance due to the risk of ABO incompatibility.,Perform the Rosette test for antibody detection in maternal serum.,Give the patient Rho(D) immune globulin.,None of the above,D,"D. Give the patient Rho(D) immune globulin. Rationale: Rh hemolytic disease occurs when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus. The mother's immune system produces antibodies against the fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia and other complications. In this case, the patient is Rh-positive and her husband is Rh-negative, so there is a risk of Rh incompatibility. The fact that the pregnancy is at 30 weeks gestation means that it is too late for the Rosette test (which is typically performed in the first trimester). Rho(D) immune globulin should be given to prevent the mother from forming antibodies against the fetal red blood cells. This will protect the fetus from Rh hemolytic disease.",False,model2

B.  Toxoplasmosis
C.  . Herpes encephalitis
D.  CNS lymphoma
E.  Cryptococcal Meningitis

###Answer:",B,"The most likely cause is:

B. Toxoplasmosis

Explanation:

The clinical presentation of a 34-year-old long-distance driver with a 3-day history of the inability to use the right side of the body, HIV positive with oral thrush, and deep hemiplegia on the right side of the body suggests a diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection often seen in HIV-positive patients.

The improvement in power to 3/5 on the affected side after the administration of Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine further supports the diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis. These medications are commonly used to treat Toxoplasmosis.

A. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is associated with JC virus in HIV patients. It typically presents with progressive neurological deficits. It does not usually show improvement with Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine.

B. Toxoplasmosis: Toxoplasmosis commonly presents with focal neurological deficits in HIV-positive patients. The improvement in power to 3/5 on the affected side after the administration of Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine supports this diagnosis.

C. Herpes encephalitis: Herpes encephalitis typically presents with acute onset of altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The improvement with Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine is not consistent with the treatment for herpes encephalitis.

D. CNS lymphoma: CNS lymphoma usually presents with focal neurological deficits, seizures, and altered mental status. It does not typically show improvement with Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine.

E. Cryptococcal meningitis: Cryptococcal meningitis typically presents with signs of meningitis such as headache, fever, and neck stiffness. Deep hemiplegia is not a typical feature. Moreover, the improvement with Cotrimoxazole and Pyrimethamine is not consistent with the treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.",Progressive multifocal Leuco-encephalopathy,Toxoplasmosis,.

During her hospital stay, she develops hypotension and a change in mental status. Her examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distension, and she is diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. What is the next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide
B.  Endotracheal intubation
C.  Cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion
D.  Bi-level positive airway pressure and bedside pericardiocentesis
E.  bed-side pericardiocentesis

###Answer:",A,"Patients with cardiac tamponade present similarly to patients with other forms of cardiogenic or obstructive shock. They may report vague symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or in more severe cases, dizziness, syncope, and altered mental status. They may also present with a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest. The classic physical findings in cardiac tamponade included in the Beck triad are hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds.

Echocardiography is the best imaging modality to use at the bedside, whether it is a point-of-care echo or a cardiology echo study. Echocardiography can confirm a pericardial effusion and can also determine its size and whether it is causing a compromise of cardiac function (right ventricular diastolic collapse, right atrial systolic collapse, or plethoric inferior vena cava).

Before rushing to decompression of the pericardium, the patient should be provided with oxygen, volume expansion, and bed rest with the legs elevated. If possible, positive pressure mechanical ventilation should be avoided as it may further decrease venous return and aggravate the symptoms.

Treatment is pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy. Needle pericardiocentesis at the bedside can be performed either with the traditional landmark technique in a subxiphoid window or using a point-of-care echo to guide needle placement in real-time.","Oxygen supplementation, IV fluid resuscitation, and pericardiocentesis under a point-of-care echocardiographic guide",Endotracheal intubation,Cardiac catheterization and labetalol infusion,Bi-level positive airway pressure and bedside pericardiocentesis,bed-side pericardiocentesis,A,"A.

C.  Protein S deficiency
D.  Lupus anticoagulant
E.  Protein C deficiency

###Answer:",B,"This patient is suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and appears to have a history of recurrent DVTs, the occurrence of which at a young age is suggestive of an inherited disorder of coagulation. Factor V Leiden (B) is a mutation of factor V which makes it resistant to the action of protein C. The increased presence of factor V therefore creates a procoagulant state predisposing to pathology such as DVTs. Factor V Leiden is one of the most common causes of an inherited procoagulant state, present in approximately 5 per cent of the Caucasian population. Although protein C (E), protein S (C) and antithrombin deficiency (A) would also cause a procoagulant state, they are much rarer.

###Answer:",C,"During fetal development, the primitive umbilical ring appears as early as 4th week of gestation on the ventral surface of the body. It contains umbilical vessels (one vein and two arteries), allantois, vitelline duct, vitelline vessels and loop of midgut. As the herniated midgut reduces, the definitive umbilical cord will develop containing the umbilical vessels surrounded by Wharton's jelly.

###Options:
A.  Perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies
B.  Perform random cervical biopsies
C.  Order HPV typing on the initial Pap smear
D.  Repeat the Pap smear to obtain endocervical cells
E.  Perform a cone biopsy of the cervix

###Answer:",A,"Any patient with a Pap smear result suggesting cervical dysplasia should undergo colposcopy, a procedure that allows for the magnified examination of the cervix. The colposcope provides a view at 10 to 16 times magnification. Pap smear is a cytological screening test for cervical neoplasms. A Pap smear result indicating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) may indicate moderate or severe cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.During colposcopy, 3% acetic acid is applied to the cervix, which helps visualize abnormal blood vessels or acetowhite areas indicating dysplasia. Any abnormal areas observed are biopsied for histologic analysis. Patients with an HGSIL Pap smear result do not require repeat testing or HPV testing, as the cytological findings suggest cervical neoplasia. Repeat Pap smear testing could yield false-negative results, delaying necessary treatment. Random cervical biopsies are not recommended as they may miss the actual abnormal tissue.Indications for a cone biopsy include unsatisfactory colposcopic examination, a colposcopically directed biopsy indicating possible invasive disease, neoplasm in the endocervix, or discrepancies between cervical biopsy results and Pap smear findings. The absence of endocervical cells in an otherwise normal Pap smear does not necessitate repeat testing. However, in such cases, endocervical curettage is recommended to evaluate the endocervical canal for neoplasia.",Perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies,Perform random cervical biopsies,Order HPV typing on the initial Pap smear,Repeat the Pap smear to obtain endocervical cells,Perform a cone biopsy of the cervix,A,"A. Perform colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies Rationale: The most appropriate next step in the management of a patient with HGSIL on Pap smear is colposcopy and directed cervical biopsies. This is because HGSIL is a high-grade lesion that carries a significant risk of progression to cervical cancer. Colposcopy allows for visualization of the cervix and identification of any abnormal areas that can be biopsied. Directed biopsies are more accurate than random biopsies in identifying the most severe lesions. The other options are not appropriate next steps:  HPV typing is not necessary at this stage, as it does not change the management.
 Repeating the Pap smear is not appropriate, as the patient already has a high-grade lesion.
 Cone biopsy is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases where colposcopy and biopsy cannot adequately assess the extent of the lesion.",True,model2

However, the proteinuria indicates pre-eclampsia is superimposed on the chronic hypertension.",Gestational hypertension.,Nephrotic syndrome.,Pre-eclampsia.,Chronic hypertension.,Chronic hypertension and superimposed pre-eclampsia.,A,"A. Gestational hypertension. Rationale: Gestational hypertension is a new onset of hypertension (e140/90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria. This patient presents with elevated blood pressure at 16 weeks gestation and proteinuria, which is not consistent with gestational hypertension. The proteinuria is also below the threshold for nephrotic syndrome (e3.5 g/24 hours) and pre-eclampsia (e0.3 g/24 hours). The fact that her blood pressure was elevated 4 weeks earlier suggests that she may have had chronic hypertension before pregnancy, but the presence of proteinuria indicates that pre-eclampsia has superimposed on the chronic hypertension.

He has a history of porphyria. The provider decides on an emergency surgery to manage the fractures. What is the mechanism of action of the drug that should be avoided in the perioperative period?
###Options:
A.  Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid
B.  Blocks the receptor site for epinephrine and norepinephrine
C.  Corrects hyponatremia
D.  Acts on GABA receptors causing post-synaptic inhibition

###Answer:",D,"Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for the treatment of seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure, and the induction of anesthesia.

Barbiturates are linked to the postsynaptic enhancement of GABA, interacting with alpha and beta subunits of the GABA receptor. Barbiturates increase chloride ion flux, which results in GABA-induced postsynaptic inhibition.

Barbiturates are known to precipitate a porphyria attack and should be avoided.

Intravenous infusion of heme is considered the first-line treatment for an acute attack. Beta-blockers are indicated for the treatment of sympathetic stimulation from a painful attack. Patients with an acute attack of porphyria should have high carbohydrate intravenous fluids (dextrose 10%).

Decreases overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid Rationale:
Porphyria is a disorder of heme synthesis that can lead to the accumulation of porphyrins, which are neurotoxic. Certain drugs, such as barbiturates, can induce the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, which increases the production of porphyrins. Therefore, drugs that decrease the overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid, such as hemin, should be used in the perioperative period for patients with porphyria.",False,model2

E.  Right ventricular diastolic compliance

###Answer:",E,"Living at high altitudes for an extended period can lead to chronic hypoxia, which can result in pulmonary hypertension and remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, including changes in right ventricular function. One of the adaptations in response to chronic hypoxia is increased right ventricular diastolic compliance.Chronic hypoxia leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, which eventually results in right ventricular hypertrophy. The hypertrophied right ventricle can adapt by becoming more compliant during diastole to accommodate the increased preload associated with the higher pulmonary vascular resistance.Therefore, in this patient who has been living at high altitude for 2 years, it is likely that right ventricular diastolic compliance has increased as an adaptive response to chronic hypoxia and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.So, the answer to the question is:(E) Right ventricular diastolic compliance",Height of P waves in lead I of the patient's ECG,Height of R waves in lead V1 of the patient's ECG,Hematocrit,Pulmonary vascular resistance,Right ventricular diastolic compliance,D,"D. Pulmonary vascular resistance Rationale: Living at high altitude leads to chronic hypoxia, which stimulates erythropoiesis and increases hematocrit.

###Answer:",C,"The clinical vignette describes a patient with non-atrophic chronic gastritis caused by colonization of the gastric antrum with Helicobacter pylori.

The inflammatory process in the antrum decreases the number of somatostatin-producing delta cells (D cells).

Somatostatin is an inhibitory hormone that suppresses gastrin secretion from G cells and pepsinogen secretion from chief cells. Gastrin is a stimulatory hormone that increases gastric H ions secretion and stimulates pepsinogen production.

Loss of inhibitory signals from somatostatin leads to enhanced pepsinogen secretion both directly and indirectly through increased gastrin production. High gastrin levels in non-atrophic chronic gastritis predispose to duodenal ulcers due to the high acidity reaching the duodenum.",Decreased gastrin due to loss of G cells,Decreased gastrin due to loss of C cells,ncreased pepsinogen secretion due to high levels of gastrin,Decreased pepsin activation due to high pH,Hypoplasia of gastrin-releasing G cells,C,"C.

Pretreatment with low-dose dexamethasone (before DEC therapy) prevents the development of the Mazzotti reaction and dramatically reduces the microfilaricidal activity of DEC. However use of diphenhydramine, after the onset of the Mazzotti reaction, had no effect on the course and intensity of the Mazzotti reaction nor microfilaricidal activity.

###Options:
A.  Delayed allergic reaction to desmopressin
B.  Thrombocytopenia
C.  Thrombocytosis
D.  Expired desmopressin
E.  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy

###Answer:",B,"Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder caused by low or dysfunctional levels of the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor. Desmopressin is a common way to treat most types of vWD but is controversial in Type 2b because of its risk of thrombocytopenia.

Type 2b, a genetic variant of the disease, is one of the most difficult subtypes of von Willebrand disease to treat. In Type 2b, there is a gain-of-function aspect in which there is an enhanced interaction between vWF and platelets resulting in abnormal glycoprotein complexes causing consumptive thrombocytopenia. This patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia as a result of her underlying diagnosis of Type 2b von Willebrand disease and the exposure to desmopressin.

Desmopressin is considered a contraindication in von Willebrand Type 2b because it enhances and increases the number of glycoprotein complexes, promoting platelet aggregation leading to clinically significant thrombocytopenia with an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding. Desmopressin should not be given to patients with this subtype.

The correct treatment for a patient with Type 2b von Willebrand disease should be von Willebrand Factor replacement and in some cases, a platelet transfusion may be needed.

###Options:
A.  Mucosal sloughing within the diverticulum
B.  Ectopic gastric epithelium in a persistent omphalomesenteric duct
C.  Incomplete bowel rotation resulting in obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery
D.  Breakdown of the stomach mucosal barrier, with erosion of the underlying mucosa
E.  gastric ulcer

###Answer:",B,"This child has a Meckel diverticulum. It is caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct, supplied by the omphalomesenteric artery, which arises from the ileal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The diverticulum often contains ectopic gastric tissue.

The ectopic gastric epithelium is present in about half of patients and can cause ulcers and painless bleeding but does not generally cause severe pain unless inflammation occurs.

Meckel diverticulum occurs on the antimesenteric border of the ileum and can bleed. The 60% of cases that contain gastric mucosa can be detected with a Meckel scan. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pertechnetate is absorbed preferentially by the gastric mucosa and thus may be used to detect ectopic gastric mucosa in the diverticulum.

###Options:
A.  Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (Pneumocystis carinii)
B.  Bone marrow transplantation
C.  Oral polio virus vaccine
D.  Monthly evaluation for Kaposi sarcoma
E.  Vitamin C supplementation

###Answer:",A,"In specific scenarios, such as when dealing with an infant born to an HIV-positive mother, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) infection is typically initiated. While awaiting confirmation of the infant's HIV status, which can take several months, starting prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 6 weeks of age is generally recommended. Severe anemia may be linked with AIDS and may necessitate blood transfusion, particularly if respiratory compromise is evident. Despite attempts, bone marrow transplants in AIDS patients have been unsuccessful due to the persistent presence of the virus in macrophages throughout the body.HIV-positive and AIDS patients should undergo primary and booster immunization with vaccines such as diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) (unless severely immunocompromised), hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugated vaccine (HibCV). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is now recommended instead of oral polio vaccine (OPV) for all patients due to the theoretical risk of paralytic polio. In the event of measles exposure, HIV-infected children should receive a protective dose of measles immunoglobulin regardless of their vaccination history. Additionally, pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax) should be administered at age 2, and influenza vaccine is recommended annually.Over time, all HIV-infected individuals are likely to experience weight loss and failure to thrive due to factors such as reduced caloric intake from poor appetite, intestinal malabsorption, and increased resting energy expenditure associated with chronic infection. Despite the challenges in maintaining adequate nutrition in AIDS patients, vitamin C supplementation alone does not offer any specific benefits. Kaposi sarcoma is rare in children.",Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (Pneumocystis carinii),Bone marrow transplantation,Oral polio virus vaccine,Monthly evaluation for Kaposi sarcoma,Vitamin C supplementation,A,"A. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (Pneumocystis carinii) Rationale:
Infants born to HIV-positive mothers are at risk for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), a life-threatening opportunistic infection. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for all infants born to HIV-positive mothers, starting at 4-6 weeks of age. This prophylaxis is essential to prevent PCP and improve the infant's chances of survival. The other options are not appropriate treatments for a 2-month-old infant born to an HIV-positive mother:
- Bone marrow transplantation is not a standard treatment for HIV infection in infants.
- Oral poliovirus vaccine is not recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers due to the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio.

She has recently given birth to a healthy baby boy and is enjoying being a mother. However, she is becoming more reliant on her partner for support as she always feels exhausted and often becomes depressed. The patient has a poor appetite and often does not finish her meals, despite this she has gained 5 kg in the last 2 weeks. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Postpartum depression
B.  Eating disorder
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Hypothyroidism
E.  Occult malignancy

###Answer:",D,"Hypothyroidism (D) is a common disease with a higher prevalence in females and is usually a primary disorder affecting the thyroid gland itself. Thyroid hormones control the metabolic rate in many tissues, underactivity produces symptoms which are often insidious. These include tiredness, depression, cold intolerance, constipation and weight gain. The main causes include iodine deficiency, autoimmune pathology such as Hashimotos thyroiditis and, in females who have recently given birth, postpartum thyroiditis. Hyperthryoidism (C) results in an excess of thyroid hormones which inappropriately increases metabolic rate with symptoms such as weight loss, increased sweating, restlessness and palpitations. A goitre can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Postpartum depression (A) is often accompanied by confusion and is characterized by low mood, anhedonia and anergia. Severely affected patients can have delusional thoughts about their newborn child, such as it being evil, and even progress to thoughts of harming the child or suicidal ideation. Eating disorders (B), such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa, often result in drastic changes in body weight resulting from psychological problems with self-image and include behaviours such as self-induced vomiting to avoid weight gain or binge eating. Most malignancies (E) result in considerable weight loss though this is dependent on the type of cancer and often symptoms provide clues as to the location, e.g. neurological problems.",Postpartum depression,Eating disorder,Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Occult malignancy,D,"D.

###Answer:",E,"Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described, the most likely diagnosis is essential thrombocythemia (ET).Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, leading to thrombocytosis. Patients with ET may present with symptoms related to thrombosis or bleeding, as well as symptoms related to the underlying disease process. In this case, the patient presents with severe arterial insufficiency of the right second toe, which could be attributed to thrombosis associated with elevated platelet counts.The laboratory findings of elevated platelet count (1300 x 10^9/L) support the diagnosis of ET. Additionally, the absence of significant past medical history and the presence of splenomegaly are consistent with ET.Other differential diagnoses may include polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), but the normal hemoglobin level (Hb of 13.5) and absence of erythrocytosis make PRV less likely.

###Answer:",C,"The vignette represents a classical presentation of acute pancreatitis with epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back and is associated with nausea and vomiting which is relieved by bending forward. Elevation in serum lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pathophysiology of pancreatitis involves both the localized destruction in the pancreas and systemic inflammatory response. The inciting event is the premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the acinar cell.

###Answer:",A,"The most probable diagnosis is autoimmune hemolytic anemia, supported by the presence of spherocytes and polychromasia. Confirmation through a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) would reveal immunoglobulin or complement proteins adherent on red blood cell surfaces. Hereditary spherocytosis is less likely given the normal findings in the full blood examination (FBE) conducted previously. Oxidative hemolysis typically presents with 'bite cells' on blood film. Reticulocytosis, as indicated by polychromasia, is an anticipated finding in autoimmune hemolysis.

The pain has been occurring intermittently for 3 days. It is not associated with exertion, does not radiate, and is ""dull"" in nature. The physical exam is remarkable for obesity and lower extremity edema. The cardiac exam is normal. Your senior registrar asked you to perfrom an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has had several prior ECGs in the past as seen in the documentation in his hospital folder. They all showed LBBB similar to the present one. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
###Options:
A.  Call a cardiac alert so the patient can receive an immediate percutaneous coronary intervention
B.  Have the patient bear down and repeat the ECG
C.  Administer a loading dose of amiodarone to the patient and repeat the ECG
D.  Check a serum troponin
E.  repeat the ECG after a few hours

###Answer:",D,"The patient's left bundle branch block (LBBB) is not new; therefore, it is not an ST-segment elevation equivalent. ECGs showing LBBB do not have interpretable ST-T wave segments and there is no mention in this case regarding any positive Sgarbossa criteria.

###Options:
A.  Self-application of imiquimod to the lesions by the patient
B.  Local excision
C.  Weekly application of trichloroacetic acid in the office
D.  Weekly application of podophyllin in the office
E.  Injection of 5-fluorouracil into the lesions

###Answer:",B,"The lesions are most likely condyloma acuminata, also known as venereal warts. They are squamous lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Microscopic examination reveals a treelike growth pattern with a mantle characterized by significant acanthosis and parakeratosis. Treatment options include local excision, cryosurgery, application of podophyllin or trichloroacetic acid, and laser therapy. However, podophyllum is not recommended for extensive disease due to its toxicity, which can cause peripheral neuropathy. For refractory condyloma of the vagina, 5-fluorouracil can be used. Medical treatments such as podophyllum, imiquimod, trichloroacetic acid, and 5-fluorouracil require weeks or months of therapy to achieve effectiveness. Given the patient's large, bleeding lesions, local excision is the preferred treatment option.",Self-application of imiquimod to the lesions by the patient,Local excision,Weekly application of trichloroacetic acid in the office,Weekly application of podophyllin in the office,Injection of 5-fluorouracil into the lesions,B,"B. Local excision Rationale: The clinical presentation is consistent with condyloma acuminata, or genital warts, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Local excision is the preferred treatment for large lesions that are causing symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain. It offers immediate removal of the lesions and can provide symptomatic relief. The other options may be appropriate for smaller lesions or as adjunctive therapies, but are not the best choice for this patient's presentation.",True,model2

This started on the fourth day of life. Phototherapy is being done, but the symptoms are not improving. Birth history is insignificant. The mother states that his brother has some issues related to liver disease. Vital signs are pulse rate 128/min, blood pressure 96/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 98.6F (37 C). Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen and jaundice. Total bilirubin despite treatment is 18 mg/dL with less than 15% direct. What is the next step in the management of this condition?
###Options:
A.  Phenobarbital
B.  Phenytoin
C.  Acetaminophen
D.  Multivitamins
E.  steroids

###Answer:",A,"In most cases of mild neonatal jaundice, no treatment is necessary, and it resolves on its own within a few weeks. In cases of moderate or severe jaundice (TB over 15 mg/dL), phototherapy is a safe option.

Phenobarbital increases both the conjugation and excretion of bilirubin by stimulating the gene for the UGT1A1 enzyme that induces the production of conjugated bilirubin and thereby reduces serum bilirubin levels by 25%.

Patients with Crigler-Najjar type II syndrome do not require any treatment and can have management with phenobarbital. Also, for Gilbert syndrome, no medical therapy is needed, and phenobarbital has been effectively shown to decrease bilirubin levels.

The common medications used for the treatment of patients with Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome are phenobarbital, calcium (infusions), ursodeoxycholic acid, metalloporphyrins, chlorpromazine, and cholestyramine.",Phenobarbital,Phenytoin,Acetaminophen,Multivitamins,steroids,A,"A. Phenobarbital Rationale: The baby has persistent jaundice despite phototherapy, with a high total bilirubin level and a low direct bilirubin level. This suggests an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The family history of liver disease suggests a possible genetic disorder, such as Gilbert's syndrome. Phenobarbital is an enzyme inducer that can increase the metabolism of bilirubin and reduce the levels of unconjugated bilirubin. It is therefore the appropriate next step in the management of this condition.",True,model2

The patient's history of epistaxis, easy bruising, and excessive bleeding after surgery, along with a family history of similar symptoms, is suggestive of a bleeding disorder. Von Willebrands disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the von Willebrand factor, which is essential for platelet adhesion and clotting. Haemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders that affect clotting factors VIII and IX, respectively. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disorder that causes low platelet counts.

###Options:
A.  Measurement of CD 8 T-cells
B.  Interferon-gamma release assay
C.  Interleukin 2 immunoassay
D.  Presence of granulomas in the lung
E.  gene Xpert

###Answer:",B,"There is a lot of controversy on the use of the Mantoux test in people who have already been immunized with BCG.

The interferon test relies on T cells releasing interferon when exposed to specific antigens.

This may help avoid false positives and unnecessary drug therapy.

A two-step testing procedure has been recommended to avoid false tests. In addition, the interferon-gamma release assays are now being used instead of the skin test.",Measurement of CD 8 T-cells,Interferon-gamma release assay,Interleukin 2 immunoassay,Presence of granulomas in the lung,gene Xpert,B,"B. Interferon-gamma release assay Rationale: The Mantoux skin test can give a false positive result in people who have received the BCG vaccine. This is because the vaccine contains a weakened form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can cause a reaction in the skin test. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are blood tests that measure the release of interferon-gamma by T cells in response to specific M. tuberculosis antigens. IGRAs are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are therefore a more accurate way to test for TB infection in people who have been vaccinated.",True,model2

The patient does not meet indications for antibiotic prophylaxis based on the new ACC/AHA guidelines. Rationale:
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have revised their guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures. According to the new guidelines, antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with mitral valve prolapse with a systolic click, as in this patient. The rationale for this change is that the risk of infective endocarditis from dental procedures is extremely low in these patients, and the potential risks of antibiotic use outweigh the benefits.",True,model2

Which of the following physical findings would warrant further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis?
###Options:
A.  Lid lag
B.  Hyperacusis
C.  Epiphora
D.  Blepharoptosis
E.  Dysgeusia

###Answer:",D,"In addition to sudden-onset hemifacial paralysis, Bell palsy is often associated with dull postauricular pain (50% of patients), excessive tearing, dry eye, pain with loud sounds, and altered taste sensation.

Epiphora in Bell palsy may be due to the following: failure of the lacrimal pump mechanism from denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle, increased tear production due to exposure keratopathy from paralytic lagophthalmos, and malposition of the lacrimal punctum and failure of tear drainage due to paralytic ectropion. Despite the epiphora, however, many patients will simultaneously report dry eye because of their inability to close it completely as a result of the Bell palsy.

Hyperacusis, or pain with loud sounds, and dysgeusia result from dysfunction of intratemporal branches of the facial nerve. If the stapedius muscle is denervated, patients lack the ability to dampen stapes movement in the presence of loud sounds, making them uncomfortable. The chorda tympani nerve, which conveys taste sensation from the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue, is also a branch of the facial nerve and often functions abnormally in patients with Bell palsy.

Patients with Bell palsy do not have blepharoptosis because Bell palsy is a dysfunction of the facial nerve, which controls the orbicularis oculi muscle, among others. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye; thus, patients with Bell palsy have paralytic lagophthalmos (difficulty closing the eye), not a droopy eyelid. The muscle that opens the eye, the levator palpebrae superioris, is controlled by the oculomotor nerve, which is unaffected in Bell palsy.",Lid lag,Hyperacusis,Epiphora,Blepharoptosis,Dysgeusia,D,"D. Blepharoptosis Rationale: Blepharoptosis (drooping of the eyelid) is not a typical finding in Bell palsy. Its presence suggests an alternative diagnosis, such as a mass or aneurysm affecting the oculomotor nerve. The other options (lid lag, hyperacusis, epiphora, and dysgeusia) are all common findings in Bell palsy and do not warrant further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis.",True,model2

###Answer:",B,"Red blood cells (RBCs) rely on glutathione from the hexose monophosphate shunt to counteract increased reactive oxygen species production, typically induced by drugs or toxins. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defects, the most common congenital issue with this shunt, hinder RBCs' ability to maintain sufficient glutathione levels during oxidant stress. Consequently, hemoglobin precipitates within RBCs, forming Heinz bodies. As the G6PD gene resides on the X chromosome, affected individuals are predominantly males. G6PD deficiency is prevalent in regions historically plagued by malaria, notably among males of African, African American, Sardinian, and Sephardic descent. While most individuals with G6PD deficiency remain asymptomatic, certain triggers like infection, fava bean ingestion, or exposure to oxidative agents can incite acute hemolytic events.

He has a fever at 39.5°C and blood pressure is 90/60mmHg, although he is in a lucid state. Bruises can be seen on his skin which he remembers being present before he fell. Blood tests show the patient to have a normocytic anaemia with a low platelet count and increased fibrin split products. The most likely diagnosis is:
###Options:
A.  Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
B.  Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
C.  Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
D.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation
E.  Thalassemia minor

###Answer:",D,"This patient is suffering from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (D), which may have resulted from an infection, in this case causing septicaemia. DIC is characterized by the systemic activation of the coagulation system such that fibrin deposition occurs usually within the microvasculature. RBCs are damaged when crossing such fibres and coagulation factors and platelets are also consumed predisposing to severe bleeding. DIC has various causes. In this case a systemic inflammatory response such as occurs in sepsis is the most likely underlying cause. Thalassaemia (E) tends to produce chronic normocytic or microcytic anaemia without serious bleeding risk. In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (C), there is a defect in an essential cell membrane protein causing intermittent release of haemoglobin, it is believed acidosis during the night increases the degree of haemoglobinuria, hence the term nocturnal. There does not tend to be consumption of coagulation factors. Haemolytic anaemia produces a macrocytic anaemia, in warm antibody disease (A) IgG binds to the red cell membrane, while in cold antibody disease (B) it is IgM. There is no impact upon coagulation factors.",Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Thalassemia minor,D,"D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation Rationale: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by widespread activation of coagulation, leading to the formation of blood clots throughout the body.

###Options:
A.  Cryotherapy of the cervix
B.  Laser ablation of the cervix
C.  Conization of the cervix
D.  Hysterectomy
E.  Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months

###Answer:",C,"One indication for a cone biopsy is when a cervical biopsy or colposcopic impression does not adequately explain the severity of the Pap smear result. In approximately 10% of cases where cervical biopsies are directed by colposcopy, there can be a significant discordance between the Pap smear and biopsy results. For instance, the biopsy may appear normal while the Pap smear indicates severely abnormal cells. Conization of the cervix becomes necessary to rule out lesions higher in the endocervical canal. Simply repeating the Pap smear is not advisable as it may delay treatment of a potentially serious issue. Once cervical dysplasia is confirmed, cryotherapy and laser ablation are viable treatment options. However, these are destructive procedures, meaning no tissue is preserved for histological evaluation, and should not be performed until a definitive diagnosis is made. It's important not to proceed with a hysterectomy in this patient without first resolving the discrepancy between the Pap smear and colposcopic findings.",Cryotherapy of the cervix,Laser ablation of the cervix,Conization of the cervix,Hysterectomy,Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months,E,"E. Repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months Rationale:
The discrepancy between the Pap smear (HGSIL) and the biopsy (chronic cervicitis) suggests a possible sampling error. In such cases, the recommended approach is to repeat the Pap smear in 3 to 6 months. If the repeat Pap smear still shows HGSIL, further investigation with a repeat colposcopy and biopsy or endocervical curettage is warranted. The other options (cryotherapy, laser ablation, conization, and hysterectomy) are premature and not indicated at this stage.",False,model2

B.  (B)	ovaries caudad to the cervix
C.  (C)	round ligaments attached to the uterus posterior to the insertion of the fallopian tubes
D.  (D)	immobility of the uterus
E.  (E)	cervix not palpable on rectal examination

###Answer:",A,"The cervix protrudes into the fornix of the vagina, and the ovaries are intraperitoneal; therefore, they are found cephalad to the cervix. The round ligaments are attached to the uterus anterior to the attachment of the fallopian tubes. Retroflexion implies a sharp angle between the cervix and the fundus of the uterus, which is bent posteriorly. This is a less common position of the uterus, which can also, more commonly, be midposition or anteflexed. These are all normal positions of the uterus. It is important to recognize which way the uterine body is flexed so that you do not perforate the lower uterine segment while sounding the uterus or dilating the cervix. The uterus is normally mobile and if it is not, adhesions or tumor may be present. The cervix is normally palpated anterior to the rectum on rectal examination.

A.  The common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula from the escharotomy
B.  Sciatic nerve compression from continued compartment swelling
C.  The sural nerve at the mid-fibula from the escharotomy
D.  The tibial nerve at the medial condyle of the femur from the escharotomy
E.  femoral nerve compression

###Answer:",A,"Common peroneal nerve injury at the neck of the fibula results in numbness to the lateral leg and foot drop.

Escharotomy involves incising through areas of burnt skin to release the eschar and its constrictive effects and restore distal circulation without breaching the deep fascial layer. Structures at risk should be marked, such as the common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula so that extra care can be taken to avoid damage to deep structures.

The common peroneal nerve has a relatively superficial course near the incisions. For this reason, an escharotomy should ideally be performed by a plastic or burn surgeon with knowledge of the underlying anatomy. The sural nerve provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle.

Following escharotomy, the wounds should be monitored regularly, especially in the first 72 hours, due to high risk of bleeding, and for signs of incomplete releases, such as distal ischemia in limbs.

C.  Bone marrow
D.  Lungs
E.  heart

###Answer:",A,"This infant presents with signs of rickets due to chronic vitamin D deficiency because breast milk has inadequate vitamin D levels to support an infant's nutritional requirements.

Dermal synthesis and dietary intake (fatty fish livers, fortified food) are the major sources of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), both of which are converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D2 (25-OH-D2) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) respectively in the liver by the enzyme hepatic enzyme 25hydroxylase. Both 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 are then converted to the most active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases bone resorption, and decreases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization, which can further result in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.

Initial supplementation for 8 weeks with vitamin D3, either 6,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly, can be considered. Once the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level exceeds 30 ng/mL, a daily maintenance dose of 1,000 to 2,000 IU is recommended",Kidney,Pancreas,Bone marrow,Lungs,heart,A,"A. Kidney Rationale:

###Answer:",C,"Seizure-like manifestations devoid of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) are indicative of pseudoseizures. These episodes often present with convincing seizure-like behaviors, including atypical posturing and vocalizations, albeit typically without loss of sphincter control. Furthermore, self-inflicted harm is uncommon, and pupillary response to light remains intact. Pseudoseizures may arise deliberately or as part of a conversion disorder, thus negating the necessity for antiepileptic medication. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that a subset of patients experiencing pseudoseizures may also suffer from genuine epileptic seizures; hence, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs is unwarranted. The optimal approach involves initiating psychiatric or psychological evaluation as the cornerstone of pseudoseizure management.",Adjust the dosage of valproic acid by increasing it.,Incorporate a scheduled benzodiazepine regimen to alleviate her muscular symptoms.,Request a psychiatric assessment for further evaluation.,Introduce carbamazepine as an adjunct to her existing seizure medication regimen.,Discontinue all seizure medications.,C,"C.

###Options:
A.  3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency
B.  11-hydroxylase deficiency

###Answer:",E,"21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Normally, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 21-hydroxylase to aldosterone and cortisol. The lack of 21-hydroxylase, therefore, leads to a deficiency of these two adrenal hormones.

The majority of affected neonates have results greater than3500 ng/dL (105 nmol/L). A very high random serum concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is highly suggestive of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Sciatica is a debilitating condition in which the patient experiences pain and/or paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution or an associated lumbosacral nerve root.

Any condition that may structurally impact or compress the sciatic nerve may cause sciatica symptoms. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. In the older population, lumbar spinal stenosis may also cause these symptoms. Spondylolisthesis or a relative misalignment of one vertebra relative to another may also result in sciatic symptoms.

Patients with sciatica usually experience pain in the lumbar spine, and almost invariably, the pain will be unilateral. A common characteristic is that pain may radiate to the ipsilateral affected extremity. Patients may often describe pain or a burning sensation deep in the buttocks, and they will frequently describe paresthesia that accompanies the pain.

The straight-leg test is a passive examination. The straight-leg test is performed by having the patient lie in a relaxed, supine position. The examiner then lifts the leg from the posterior aspect flexing at the hip joint and keeping the knee in full extension or keeping the leg straight. Typically pain that is reproduced between 30 to 70 degrees of hip flexion and experienced primarily in the back is likely due to a lumbar disc herniation. A contralateral or cross-straight leg raise is positive when symptoms in the affected extremity are reproduced by raising the unaffected leg.",0 to 30 degrees,30 to 70 degrees,70 to 90 degrees,greater than 90 degrees,80 to 90 degrees,B,"B.  30 to 70 degrees Rationale:
The straight leg raise (SLR) test is used to confirm sciatica. With the patient supine, the examiner raises the affected leg while keeping the knee extended. A positive test, indicating nerve root irritation, is elicited when the patient experiences pain radiating down the leg at an angle of hip flexion between 30 and 70 degrees.",True,model2

###Answer:",C,"A stent is placed within a coronary artery to keep the artery patent. A stent is a small mesh-like tube made of metal or fabric that is inserted into the artery to prevent it from narrowing or becoming blocked. It helps to improve blood flow and prevent complications such as heart attacks. A valve is not used for this purpose, and a stint and catheter are incorrect spellings of the word stent.",Valve,Stint,Stent,Catheter,Defribillator,B,"B. Stent Rationale:

Upon clinical examination, doctors notice an acutely swollen mass located in the groin, extending to the scrotum. What is the most probable diagnosis and whats the most appropriate management?
###Options:
A.  Incarcerated direct inguinal hernia, analgesia, sedation and attempt to reduce
B.  Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, emergency surgery
C.  Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, analgesia, sedation and attempt to reduce

E.  Incarcerated direct inguinal hernia, emergency surgery

###Answer:",C,"An incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia presents with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and intestinal obstruction. It is characterized by the appearance of a tender mass in the inguinal area. Manual reduction in children requires analgesia and sedation","Incarcerated direct inguinal hernia, analgesia, sedation and attempt to reduce","Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, emergency surgery","Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, analgesia, sedation and attempt to reduce","Incarcerated femoral hernia, emergency surgery","Incarcerated direct inguinal hernia, emergency surgery",B,"B. Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, emergency surgery Rationale: The clinical presentation of a young boy with an acutely swollen mass in the groin that extends to the scrotum, along with an episode of green vomiting, is highly suggestive of an incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia. Green vomiting indicates intestinal obstruction, which is a complication of an incarcerated hernia. Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in children, and they occur when the processus vaginalis fails to close, allowing abdominal contents to protrude through the inguinal canal. When the hernia becomes incarcerated, it cannot be reduced manually, and it can lead to intestinal obstruction and ischemia. Emergency surgery is the appropriate management for an incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia to prevent further complications such as bowel perforation or necrosis. Analgesia and sedation may be used before surgery to manage pain and anxiety, but they are not sufficient treatments for an incarcerated hernia.",False,model2

###Options:
A.  Arterial Po2
B.  Right atrial pressure
C.  Aortic pressure
D.  Left ventricular pressure
E.  None of the above

###Answer:",B,"Right atrial pressure falls dramatically after the onset of breathing due to a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure.
",Arterial Po2,Right atrial pressure,Aortic pressure,Left ventricular pressure,None of the above,B,"B. Right atrial pressure Rationale:
In the fetus, the right atrial pressure is greater than the left atrial pressure due to the presence of the foramen ovale. This allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs. After birth, the foramen ovale closes and the left atrial pressure becomes greater than the right atrial pressure.",True,model2

###Answer:",E,"ADH controls whether high amounts of dilute or concentrated urine is formed. In the absence of ADH, urine is very dilute. In the presence of ADH, Urine is concentrated. ",Renin,TSH,Oxytocin,Prolactin,ADH,E,"E. ADH Rationale:
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is a hormone that regulates water balance in the body. It acts on the kidneys to promote water reabsorption, reducing the amount of water excreted in the urine. This helps to maintain the body's fluid balance and prevent dehydration.",True,model2

###Answer:",D,Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to extensive cicatrization from chronic duodenal ulcer of disease is best treated by Bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy.,Highly selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty,Selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty,Heineken-Milkulz procedure,Bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,Bilateral truncal vagotomy and partial gastrectomy,D,"D. Bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy Rationale: Gastric outlet obstruction due to cicatrization from chronic duodenal ulcer disease requires a procedure that addresses both the obstruction and the underlying acid hypersecretion. Bilateral truncal vagotomy reduces acid secretion, while gastrojejunostomy bypasses the obstructed pylorus. This combination of procedures provides the best long-term results for patients with this condition. The other options are not as effective:
 Highly selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty only address the obstruction and do not reduce acid secretion.
 Selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty may not be sufficient to reduce acid secretion enough to prevent recurrence of ulceration.
 Heineken-Milkulz procedure is a type of pyloroplasty that is not as effective as gastrojejunostomy.
 Bilateral truncal vagotomy and partial gastrectomy is a more extensive procedure that is not necessary in most cases.",True,model2

A.  Massive pulmonary embolism
B.  Methanol poisoning
C.  Paraquat poisoning
D.  Diabetic ketoacidosis
E.  Lead poisoning

###Answer:",B,"This patient has a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis which may be caused by methanol poisoning.

Methanol is a toxic alcohol that can cause metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and an elevated anion gap.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of uncontrolled diabetes that can cause metabolic acidosis. In this case, the blood gases show a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and an elevated anion gap, which are consistent with metabolic acidosis. However, normal glucose levels make DKA an unlikely diagnosis.

Paraquat is a herbicide that can cause acute lung injury, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. Renal functions are normal in this patient.",Massive pulmonary embolism,Methanol poisoning,Paraquat poisoning,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Lead poisoning,B,"B. Methanol poisoning Rationale: The patient's blood gas results show a metabolic acidosis with a low pH (7.23) and low bicarbonate (12 mEq/L). The pCO2 is low (22 mmHg), indicating a respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis. The anion gap is not elevated, as the difference between the sodium and the sum of chloride and bicarbonate is only 22 mEq/L. This suggests an organic acidosis, such as methanol poisoning. The other options would not be consistent with the blood gas results and electrolyte abnormalities.",True,model2

###Answer:",D,"The most likely diagnosis, considering the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, is leptospirosis.

The infection is acquired by coming into contact with infected animals or their urine. Leptospira can be acquired after contact with contaminated soil and water.

Avoiding wading in still and stagnant water contaminated by animal feces and urine can prevent infection.

Preexposure prophylaxis with chloroquine is effective for malaria prevention when traveling to endemic areas. Applying mosquito repellant can be used to prevent dengue infection.

Applying mosquito repellant Rationale:
The patient's presentation is consistent with dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection. The most effective way to prevent dengue fever is to avoid mosquito bites by using mosquito repellant. Hawaii is an area where dengue fever is endemic. The other options would not have prevented dengue fever:
- Chloroquine is used for malaria prophylaxis, not dengue fever.
- There is no vaccine available for dengue fever.
